Read Today's Paper Wipro Q4 Results Preview: PAT may rise 16% YoY; margins to be stable SECTIONS Wipro Q4 Results Preview: PAT may rise 16% YoY; margins to be stable By Akash Podishetti , ETMarkets.com Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 11:02:00 AM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Wipro anticipates a revenue decline in constant currency for Q4, likely near the lower end of its -1% to 1% guidance. While revenue from operations may see a slight YoY increase, net profit is expected to jump significantly. Investors will closely monitor discretionary spending, particularly within the financial services sector, amid macroeconomic concerns. ETMarkets.com Investors will be closely watching discretionary spending trends and the performance of the BFSI sector. Deterioration in demand will lead to revenue decline for Wipro in constant currency terms in the fourth quarter. The drop will be more or less towards the lower end of -1 to 1% range of guidance. Consolidated revenue from operations during the January-March 2024 period is seen rising by a marginal 2% year-on-year (YoY), according to an average estimate of six brokerages. The CC revenue decline is expected to be around 0.4%. Net profit during the reporting period is likely to jump 16% YoY, the estimates revealed. For the fourth quarter, margins are expected to remain in a narrow band, with no significant headwinds anticipated. Wage hikes are behind and fully absorbed in the preceding third quarter. Investor focus will be on state of discretionary spending by clients in light of recent macro deterioration and spending in financial services accounts noting Wipro's high discretionary exposure to the vertical Here's what analysts expect from Wipro's Q4 Live Events Nomura We expect revenues to decline 0.4% QoQ in cc as against its guided band of - 1% to 1% for 4Q. We expect WPRO to guide for -1.5% to +0.5% revenue growth in 1Q FY26F (in cc). We expect EBIT margins to remain stable QoQ. Key things to watch out for - commentary on consulting business (particularly in BFSI vertical), client specific issues in BFSI vertical, large deal pipeline and outlook on client discretionary spend. Motilal Oswal Wipro is likely to report flat revenue in 4Q (midpoint of its 4Q guidance) as softness may persist in Energy, Manufacturing and Resources, along with Europe and APMEA regions. BFSI may perform better sequentially due to uptick in budgets and Capco business. Healthcare will also grow, but slower than in the past. Key monitorables include commentary on recovery in Europe region also Energy, Manufacturing and resources verticals. Nuvama We expect IT Services revenue growth of -0.4% QoQ in CC and -1.0% QoQ in USD. Margins are likely to largely remain flat QoQ. We expect Wipro to give -1% to +1% CC QoQ revenue growth guidance for Q1FY26. Will look for update on consultancy business and deal execution Kotak Equities We forecast a stable EBIT margin with benefit from rupee depreciation, offset by lack of operating leverage/revenue decline. We expect a large deal TCV to be in the $1.6-1.8 billion range, taking into consideration the Phoenix mega-deal. We expect a revenue guidance range of -0.5% to +1.5% for the June 2025 quarter.

He proposes locating SAF refineries near airports to cut transportation costs and integrating SAF production into existing oil refineries. Singh emphasizes the need for significant incentives and logistical support to scale up SAF production from 0. Agencies The government and industry have to come together and create a \"significant incentive and logistic structure\" for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to help reduce carbon emissions, SpiceJet CMD Ajay Singh said on Wednesday. Discussions have been held with the Prime Minister's Office for allotment of spaces near airports for SAF refineries to save on transportation costs, and also with oil marketing companies, including IOC , BPCL and HPCL , to build a mini refinery for SAF production in their existing refineries, he added. \"I think one of the things that we need to do is to have these SAF refineries, which are relatively simpler, probably closer to airports. If you're really serious about it. We've had this discussion with the PMO as well, that, can you allot spaces, which are close to airports so that the transport cost, which is the largest part of that cost, because you know you have to address these issues,\" Singh said. The SpiceJet CMD said at that some point the government and the industry have to get together and create a significant incentive and logistic structure to make SAF. In 2023, the production of SAF stood at around 0.5 million tonnes and the amount has to be increased multiple folds by 2050. Live Events The International Air Transport Association (IATA) earlier said it would establish the SAF Registry to accelerate the uptake of the fuel by authoritatively accounting for and reporting emissions reductions from the use of the fuel.

Full Holy Week Calendar Global Desk Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 05:23:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis As Holy Week 2025 approaches, Christian communities around the world will enter a period of reflection, sacrifice, and renewal\u2014culminating in the joy of Easter Sunday. Easter Sunday in 2025 will be observed on April 20, marking the culmination of the Holy Week, the most sacred time in the Christian liturgical calendar. The day celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which lies at the heart of Christian belief. As per ecclesiastical tradition, Easter falls on the first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon, which follows the spring equinox. This movable feast shifts annually depending on lunar patterns, and in 2025, the alignment places Easter Sunday toward the latter half of April, giving believers ample time to journey through Lent and Holy Week in spiritual preparation. Holy Week 2025: Full Calendar and Key Dates Holy Week 2025 begins on Palm Sunday, April 13, and concludes on Easter Sunday, April 20. The week is observed globally with both solemn reflection and celebratory liturgies that chronicle the final days of Christ\u2019s life, crucifixion, and resurrection. Live Events The detailed Holy Week schedule for 2025 is as follows: Palm Sunday \u2013 April 13: Marks Jesus\u2019 triumphant entry into Jerusalem, with faithful carrying palm branches in processions. Holy Monday to Holy Wednesday \u2013 April 14 to April 16: While not as widely recognized by unique rituals, these days are commemorated through scripture readings and daily Mass. Holy Thursday (Maundy Thursday) \u2013 April 17: Remembers the Last Supper and Jesus\u2019 act of foot-washing. \u201cMaundy\u201d comes from the Latin mandatum, referring to the commandment to love and serve one another. Good Friday \u2013 April 18: A solemn day honoring Christ\u2019s crucifixion. Churches conduct services marked by silence, reflection, and the reading of the Passion. Holy Saturday \u2013 April 19: Known for the Easter Vigil service held at night, leading into Easter celebrations. Easter Sunday \u2013 April 20: Celebrated with joy and festivity as Christians commemorate the resurrection of Jesus. How Easter and Good Friday Are Celebrated Worldwide Across continents, Easter and Good Friday are observed with deep reverence. Good Friday, especially, is marked by fasting and abstinence. Traditionally, many Christians refrain from eating flesh meat such as beef or poultry, instead opting for fish, as a symbolic remembrance of Christ\u2019s sacrifice. The Lenten period leading into Easter spans 40 days, excluding Sundays, and is characterized by fasting, prayer, acts of charity, and personal sacrifice. Some give up luxuries like sweets or social media; others dedicate time to spiritual growth. In many regions, Easter Sunday is accompanied by festive church services, candle-lit vigils, and community gatherings. Countries such as Italy, the Philippines, and Spain hold large-scale public processions, while in the United States and parts of Europe, Easter egg hunts and sunrise services are widespread. FAQs: When is Easter Sunday in 2025? Easter Sunday will be observed on April 20, 2025. Why does the date of Easter change every year? Easter is a movable feast that falls on the first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon following the spring equinox, which causes the date to shift each year based on lunar cycles.

The bank plans to file a rectification application with the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer (JAO) immediately, deeming the demand unsubstantiated. Yes Bank will also pursue all available remedies, including filing an appeal against the order. Reuters Yes Bank on Wednesday said it has received a demand notice of Rs 244.20 crore for assessment year 2016-17. The reassessment order considered the income reported in the return of income instead of assessed income, for computing the reassessed income and tax thereon, Yes Bank said in a regulatory filing. Towards this, on April 15, 2025, the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer (JAO), passed the rectification order rectifying the mistake and recomputed the tax demand , it said. \"The said rectification order read with Computation Sheet and Notice of Demand has however resulted into additional tax demand of Rs 244.20 crore...has been recomputed significantly upwards, without any cogent reasons,\" it said. Against this order, the bank would file rectification application with JAO on an immediate basis as the demand appears to be unsubstantiated, and further, the bank would pursue all other available remedies, including filing an appeal, it said.

Weak Nasdaq cues and flat revenue growth tempered investor sentiment. Reuters Wipro's Q4 profit beat estimates with 26% growth, but ADRs fell 7% amid broader tech selloff and muted revenue performance in constant currency terms. American Depository Receipts (ADRs) of Wipro fell 7% to hit a low of $2.63 on Wednesday not with standing company's Q4FY25 earnings where the IT service company reported 26% year-on-year growth in net profit at Rs 3,570 crore from Rs 2,835 crore in the year-ago period. The profit is attributable to shareholders of the company and beat D-Street's expectations of Rs 3,290 crore. Wipro ADR fell today tracking the weakness in the US stock markets, more so in the tech benchmark Nasdaq Composite which was down by nearly 2% in the opening trade. The earnings were announced after Indian stock market hours and shares of Wipro today ended at Rs 247.60 on the NSE, up by Rs 3.60 or 1.48% over the Tuesday closing price. In the analyst call later today, Wipro CEO Srini Pallia underscored that the tariffs have created uncertainty for the company's clients. Live Events Revenue from operations in the quarter rose 1% year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 22,504 crore, compared to Rs 22,208 crore in the same period last year. The IT services segment revenue stood at $2,596.5 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting a decline of 1.2% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) and 2.3% year-on-year (YoY). In constant currency terms, IT services revenue decreased 0.8% QoQ and 1.2% YoY. On a sequential basis, revenue increased by a marginal 0.8%. The profit after tax grew 6% QoQ from Rs 3,354 crore posted in the preceding December quarter. In its guidance, the company said that it expects revenue from the IT Services business segment to be between $2,505 million and $2,557 million, implying a sequential decline of -3.5% to -1.5% in constant currency terms.

The initial phase involves a \u20b94,000 crore investment to establish manufacturing units, aiming to support India's 500 GW renewable energy target. TIL Creatives (Representative image) NEW DELHI: BC Jindal Group on Tuesday announced its foray into renewable energy component manufacturing space with a plan to invest Rs 15,000 crore by 2030. In a move to expand its business portfolio, the group will diversify and commence manufacturing of key components, including solar cells and modules, storage battery cells, and assembly and solar glass, the company said in a statement. BC Jindal Group, India's leading conglomerate with over Rs 18,000 crore annual turnover, has announced its strategic entry into component manufacturing for renewable energy power generation, the statement said. The group aims to achieve capacity additions with investments to the tune of Rs 15,000 crore by 2030, it stated. In the first phase of the project, the group aims to deploy an investment of Rs 4,000 crore to kickstart its renewable energy component manufacturing venture. This phase will include setting up 2 GW of solar cell manufacturing/ solar module production, 4 GWh of battery storage capacity, and a solar glass manufacturing unit with a capacity of 1,200 tonnes per day. Live Events \"Our foray into the renewable energy component manufacturing sector is a reflection of our unswerving commitment towards supporting India's vision of installing 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. At BC Jindal, we foresee a rising demand for end-to-end products and plan to leverage our expertise in the renewable energy space to offer sustainable solutions,\" a BC Jindal Group spokesperson said. The conglomerate announced that it has shortlisted two states -- Maharashtra and Gujarat -- to set up production facilities for renewable energy equipment manufacturing. \"Approximately 40 per cent of the manufacturing output is likely to be captively consumed for our renewable energy generation projects,\" the spokesperson added. Recently, the group's renewable energy arm, Jindal India Renewable Energy (JIRE), secured a 300 MW solar-plus-battery energy storage project (BESS) from NHPC , signalling its expertise in large-scale renewable projects. Last year, the group launched JIRE with an aim to generate 5 GW of power through solar, wind, hybrid, and FDRE (Firm & Dispatchable Renewable Energy) solutions to boost the country's decarbonisation goals and support its transition to clean energy. For this, BC Jindal Group had planned to invest USD 2.5 billion in the renewable energy sector over the next five years to meet India's growing energy demand while enhancing grid stability through battery energy storage systems. Additionally, JIRE is strengthening its presence in renewable energy-rich states by developing projects connected to Central Transmission Utility (CTU) and State Transmission Utility (STU) networks.

This move, aimed at reducing the cost of savings accounts, could improve banks' Net Interest Margin. ETMarkets.com ICICI Bank ICICI Bank , India\u2019s second-largest private lender, has reduced its savings account interest rates by 25 basis points, following similar actions by HDFC Bank and Axis Bank in recent days. The new interest rates for ICICI Bank\u2019s savings accounts are 2.75% per annum for balances below Rs 50 lakh and 3.25% per annum for balances of Rs 50 lakh and above. Analysts from Anand Rathi noted that this rate cut is a more structural move aimed at reducing the cost of savings accounts. \"Our calculations suggest that a 25 bps reduction in savings rates could improve the Net Interest Margin (NIM) by 5-8 basis points for the banks we cover,\" they said. Earlier this week, HDFC Bank also reduced its savings interest rate by 25 bps, bringing it to 2.75% for balances under Rs 50 lakh. This marks HDFC\u2019s first savings rate cut in five years. The State Bank of India ( SBI ) has already been offering 2.7% for balances under Rs 10 crore since October 2022. Industry experts believe other private banks will likely follow this trend, preparing depositors for a potential broader rate-cut cycle in the medium term. Live Events \"Savings deposit accounts are more transactional in nature, and recently, depositors have been shifting to term deposits where interest rates are significantly higher\u2014close to 7%,\" said Suresh Ganapathy, Head of Financial Services Research at Macquarie Capital. \"A further 25 bps cut may not necessarily push depositors towards term deposits.\" The interest rate reduction is seen as a strategy to address the headwinds of NIM contraction, especially for private banks with significant exposure to loans linked to external benchmarks like the repo rate, during an interest rate easing cycle. In addition to the savings account rate cuts , several banks have reduced their term deposit rates across various maturity periods. This should ease concerns about significant NIM declines in the first half of this fiscal year. HDFC Bank, for example, has ended its special deposit scheme that offered 7.35% on 35-month retail deposits and 7.40% on 55-month deposits. These tenures are now offering 7% interest. Yes Bank has also lowered its fixed deposit rates by 0.25 percentage points on select tenures. Bajaj Finance has reduced its interest rates by 0.25 percentage points for longer-tenure fixed deposits. Starting April 10, it will offer 8.15% on 42-month fixed deposits. Bandhan Bank has also adjusted its savings account rates. It is now offering interest rates between 3% and 5% for balances between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, compared to a flat 6% rate previously. This reduction is particularly focused on special deposits, which were introduced temporarily (until March 31) to attract resources amid intense competition to gather liabilities.

The redemption price for premature redemption due on April 16, 2025, shall be Rs 9221 per unit of SGB based on the simple average of closing gold price for the three business days i.e., April 09, April 11, and April 15, 2025. TIL Creatives Individual SGB investors of Series III 2017-18 to get 211% return on investment completely free of income tax The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced the pre-mature redemption price of Rs 9,221 per bond of Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) Series III 2017-18 . The bonds are due for premature redemption on April 16, 2025, and this is the 8th year of these bonds, which means there will be one more window for final redemption. The premature redemption window for SGBs opens twice every year from the 5th year onwards. The interest in SGBs is also paid twice semi-annually around the same time. Income Tax Guide Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 Income Tax Calculator 2025 New Income Tax Bill 2025 Read below to know more about what the RBI has said about SGB Series III 2017-18 and how investors can get income tax free returns of 211% on their SGB investment. 211% absolute return on SGB Series III 2017-18 premature redemption The SGB Series III 2017-18 was originally issued at Rs 2964 per SGB. A unit of SGB represents one gram of gold. If we calculate then the absolute return comes to: Issue price: Rs 2,964 Pre-mature redemption price: Rs 9,221 Absolute return= Rs 9,221-2,964= Rs 6,257 Absolute return: 6257/2964*100= 211.1% Redemption of SGBs is exempt from capital gains tax for individual investors. However, this tax exemption is only for individuals and not for companies and HUFs and others. Also, individuals don\u2019t get this capital gains tax exemption if they sell their SGB on the stock market. Any interest earned in investing in SGBs is taxable for all. Live Events Also read: 3 SGBs due for premature redemption in April 2025: How much gold bond investors are expected to earn The RBI said in a circular dated April 15, 2025: \u201cThe next due date of premature redemption of the Series III of SGB 2017-18 tranche shall be April 16, 2025. Further, the redemption price of SGB shall be based on the simple average of closing gold price of 999 purity of previous three business days from the date of redemption, as published by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association Ltd (IBJA). Accordingly, the redemption price for premature redemption due on April 16, 2025, shall be Rs 9221 per unit of SGB based on the simple average of closing gold price for the three business days i.e., April 09, April 11, and April 15, 2025.\u201d The RBI further added: Premature redemption under Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) Scheme - Redemption Price for premature redemption due on April 16, 2025 (Series III of SGB 2017-18) In terms of GOI Notification F. No.4(25)-W&M/2017 dated October 06, 2017 (SGB 2017-18 Series III-Issue date October 16, 2017) on Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme, premature redemption of Gold Bond may be permitted after fifth year from the date of issue of such Gold Bond on the date on which interest is payable.\u201d Series III of SGB 2017-18 is set to be open for final redemption in six months Though you can wait six more months for the final redemption window of this SGB (Series III of SGB 2017-18), but you need to take a judgement call whether to redeem these SGBs at Rs 9,221 per bond now through the April 16, 2025 premature redemption window or wait till the final redemption window. This is because the RBI announces the price of the redemption of these bonds based on prevailing gold rates around pre-mature redemption or maturity dates. \u201cThough the tenor of the bond is 8 years, early encashment/redemption of the bond is allowed after the fifth year from the date of issue on coupon payment dates. The Bonds bear interest at the rate of 2.50 per cent (fixed rate) per annum on the amount of initial investment. Interest will be credited semi-annually to the bank account of the investor and the last interest will be payable on maturity along with the principal,\u201d as per a frequently asked question (FAQ) by the RBI.

Read Today's Paper China tells Donald Trump to 'stop threatening and blackmailing' SECTIONS China tells Donald Trump to 'stop threatening and blackmailing' By AFP Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 08:09:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis China has urged the US to cease its \"threatening and blackmailing\" tactics and engage in respectful dialogue to resolve the ongoing trade war, following President Trump's imposition of tariffs reaching up to 245% on some Chinese goods. Beijing insists on equality and mutual benefit in negotiations, emphasizing that while it doesn't seek conflict, it's prepared to defend its interests. Agencies China told Washington on Wednesday to \"stop threatening and blackmailing\" after US President Donald Trump said it was up to Beijing to come to the negotiating table to discuss ending their trade war. Trump has slapped new tariffs on friend and foe alike but has reserved his heaviest blows for China, with new levies of up to 145 percent on many Chinese imports even as Beijing has retaliated with duties on US goods of 125 percent. \"If the US really wants to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiation, it should stop exerting extreme pressure, stop threatening and blackmailing, and talk to China on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said. \"China's position has been very clear. There is no winner in a tariff war or a trade war,\" Lin said, adding: \"China does not want to fight, but it is not afraid to fight.\" Trump's new levies mean that the tariffs on certain Chinese goods are as high as 245 percent, which the White House said in a factsheet on Tuesday were \"as a result of its retaliatory actions\". Live Events Beijing's commerce ministry said in a statement later on Wednesday it had \"noted that the cumulative tariffs on some individual Chinese exports to the US have reached 245 percent under various designations\", without detailing the scope of the products affected. \"The United States has instrumentalized and weaponized tariffs to a completely irrational level,\" the ministry said, adding that China would \"ignore the US's utterly meaningless tariff numbers game\". The Republican initially imposed 20 percent tariffs on imports from China over its alleged role in the fentanyl supply chain, on top of duties from previous administrations, then added 125 percent over trade practices that Washington deems unfair. His administration has, however, given temporary reprieve for certain tech products such as smartphones and laptops. The White House said on Tuesday it was up to Beijing to make the first move towards ending the dispute, which economists warn could cause a global recession. \"The ball is in China's court. China needs to make a deal with us. We don't have to make a deal with them,\" said a statement from Trump read out by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. - China growth - China said on Wednesday its economy grew a forecast-beating 5.4 percent in the first quarter as exporters rushed to get goods out of factory gates ahead of the US levies. \"The escalation happening in April is going to be felt in the second-quarter figures as the tariffs will send stateside firms looking to other suppliers, impeding Chinese exports and slamming the brakes on investment,\" Heron Lim from Moody's Analytics told AFP. Japan's envoy for talks slated for Wednesday in Washington said he was optimistic of a \"win-win\" outcome for both countries. Ryosei Akazawa, who was due to meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, said he would \"protect our national interest\". Carmaker Honda said on Wednesday it will shift production of its hybrid Civic model from Japan to the United States, although that represents a very small part of its global output. The rationale behind the decision \"is not a single issue\", a spokesman for the Japanese firm said. \"The decision is based on the company's policy since its foundation that we produce cars where the demand is.\" South Korea, another major exporter in particular of semiconductors and cars, said Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok would meet Bessent next week. \"The current priority is to use negotiations... to delay the imposition of reciprocal tariffs as much as possible and to minimise uncertainty for Korean companies operating not only in the US but also in global markets,\" Choi said on Tuesday. Trump has imposed the steep duties on imports from China since the start of the year, alongside his 10 percent \"baseline\" tariff on many US trading partners. His administration recently widened its exemptions from those tariffs, excluding certain tech products like smartphones and laptops from the global 10 percent tariff and the 125 percent levy on China. Chip stocks across Asia slumped after Nvidia said it expects a $5.5 billion hit due to a new US licensing requirement on the primary chip it can legally sell in China. Trump also ordered a probe on Tuesday that may result in tariffs on critical minerals, rare-earth metals and associated products such as smartphones.

Read Today's Paper India asks telcos to reveal Chinese gear in networks amid US-China trade war SECTIONS India asks telcos to reveal Chinese gear in networks amid US-China trade war By Kiran Rathee , ET Bureau Last Updated: Apr 14, 2025, 08:40:00 AM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Amid US-China trade tensions, India is scrutinizing Chinese telecom equipment in its networks, seeking details from all telcos. The move aims to preempt potential security threats, though Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE are already kept out of 5G rollouts. ANI New Delhi: India has sought details from all the telecom operators about Chinese equipment deployed in their networks amid an escalating US-China tariff war. \u201cThe Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has written recently to all telcos to provide details of Chinese equipment in their networks,\u201d a person privy to the details told ET. Multiple sources also said New Delhi wants to keep track of the Chinese involvement in India\u2019s communication space to pre-empt potential security threats from likely vulnerabilities in telecom networks. Some experts believed the tariff war between the US and China could boost trade ties between India and China. But the Centre, over the weekend, made it clear that it would not encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) from China, despite the tariff war between the two largest economies on the planet. Legacy contracts While Chinese network equipment suppliers such as Huawei and ZTE have been effectively kept out of India\u2019s 5G rollouts, they are still servicing a section of the 4G infrastructure. Live Events These include the core, wireless and optical segments of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea and 2G services of state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL). Another person told ET that Huawei gets around Rs 600 crore from Indian telecom operators annually as maintenance charges, while the amount for ZTE is much lower. Queries sent to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Reliance Jio and BSNL remained unanswered at the time of going to press. Huawei, too, offered no comment. ZTE couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. The Chinese companies are allowed to service the existing equipment, including replacement and upgradation of certain gear, but are kept out of new contracts. The latest move by the DoT follows another similar exercise undertaken last year. Back then, the government wanted to get an idea around the quantum of SIM cards with Chinese connections. During the 2G and 3G rollouts, most of the SIM cards used to come from China. But the situation changed once 4G was launched and now with 5G, all SIM cards are sourced locally. The government is not looking to replace the existing Chinese equipment as of now as it would involve a large expenditure by telcos, particularly, for the older players like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. \u201cThe share of Chinese firms is coming down\u2026if any equipment needs to be replaced will depend on the details provided by the telcos,\u201d said an official, without elaborating. 'Trusted sources' As per National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) mandate in place since 2021 \u2014 a few months after the border spat with China \u2014 suppliers need to get approval as a \u2018trusted source\u2019 to be eligible to supply telecom network gear. These need to be certified as \u2018trusted products\u2019 under fresh contracts. The Chinese companies have so far failed to secure the trusted sources tag, in contrast with the likes of Sweden\u2019s Ericsson, Finland\u2019s Nokia and Korea\u2019s Samsung that now have the requisite security clearances to bid for deals. The trusted source tag is given to a company after due diligence by more than 10 ministries, including home, external and communications, to ensure there is no security threat. But with more than 200 million subscribers still on 2G networks, and some even on 3G that is being rapidly phased out by telcos, there would still be a significant number of old SIM cards with Chinese chips active and may be required to be replaced in the future, say officials. To ensure more network security, the government has been pushing for self-reliance in the telecommunications sector. Besides hardware, the thrust is to develop software in-country as well. The development of local 4G and 5G stacks have been one of the top priorities for the government as the country not only wants to become self-sufficient in telecom equipment manufacturing, but also aims to be an exporter, competing with the likes of Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung.

Read Today's Paper Supreme Court tightens grip on cash deals: Courts must report transactions over Rs 2 lakh to I-T department SECTIONS Supreme Court tightens grip on cash deals: Courts must report transactions over Rs 2 lakh to I-T department By Indu Bhan , ET Bureau Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 08:06:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis The Supreme Court has directed lower courts and sub-registrars to report cash transactions of Rs 2 lakh and above to the Income Tax Department, aiming to curb black money and tax evasion. This directive ensures scrutiny of property transactions and potential violations of Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act, which prohibits large cash receipts. iStock In a significant judgment aimed at checking black money and tax evasion, the Supreme Court on Wednesday asked that the lower courts to notify the income tax department if any suit claims to have made a cash transaction of Rs 2 lakh and above. This is to intimate the tax authorities to verify the transactions and check violation of Section 269 ST of the Income Tax Act, 1961. A Bench comprising Justices JB Pardiwala and R. Mahadevan said that whenever, a sum of Rs 2 lakh and above is claimed to be paid by cash towards consideration for conveyance of any immovable property in a document presented for registration, the sub-registrar shall inform the income tax authority, who shall follow the due process in law before taking any action. Under Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act, it is prohibited for any person to receive an amount of Rs 2 lakh or more in cash, from a person in a day, either for a single transaction or for multiple transactions related to one event or occasion. If a person receives the amount in cash of Rs 2 lakh or more, he is liable to pay a penalty equal to the amount received in cash. \u201cWhenever, it comes to the knowledge of any income tax authority that a sum of Rs 2 lakh and above has been paid by way of consideration in any transaction relating to any immovable property from any other source or during the course of search or assessment proceedings, the failure of the registering authority shall be brought to the knowledge of the chief secretary of the state, the top court said. The chief secretary can then initiate disciplinary action against such an officer who failed to intimate the transaction, according to the judgment. Live Events SC advocate Abraham Mathews, who was one of the counsels in the case, said that \u2018while this might be the most effective way of enforcing the prohibition on cash transactions in Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act, this might put homebuyers completely at the mercy of a truant builder (even though the penalty under law is on the receiver).\u201d However, he said that the immediate impact will be that those who have paid or received over Rs two lakh in cash will be \u201creluctant to approach the legal system in case they have genuine grievances against the counter-party. \u201c Earlier, in the event of a dispute, the cash portion paid was often disclosed as such, and courts turned a blind eye to the infraction, he said. According to legal expert, \u201cthe penalty under the income tax law is on the receiver and its usually the payer who has to go to court. But even then, given the income tax officer can enquire about the source of the cash, even the payer (homebuyer, for instance) will feel reluctant to go to court.\u201d The SC also noted that most times, such transactions go unnoticed or not brought to the knowledge of the income tax authorities. It is a settled position that ignorance in fact is excusable but not the ignorance in law, the court said while hearing a property dispute involving Bengaluru-based RBANMS Educational Institution.

Read Today's Paper Puravankara registers 9% annual jump in collection in Q4 FY25 SECTIONS Puravankara registers 9% annual jump in collection in Q4 FY25 By Sobia Khan , ET Bureau Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 08:06:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Puravankara reported strong FY25 results, with customer collections up 9% to Rs 3,937 crore and pre-sales reaching Rs 5,006 crore. The company invested heavily in land acquisition and plans significant project launches in FY26. Despite a slightly tempered economic outlook, the real estate sector remains robust, driven by premium housing demand. TNN Puravankara , a real estate development firm has reported customer collections of Rs 3,937 crore in FY25, a 9% year-on-year growth. The collections for Q4FY25 stood at Rs 946 crores. Pre-sales for Q4FY25 stood at Rs 1,282 crore, bringing the total sales value for FY25 to Rs 5,006 crore. The average price realisation increased by 10% to Rs 8830 per sqft during the last financial year. Ashish Puravankara, Managing Director, Puravankara Ltd. , said,\u201cOur pre-sales for the year stood at Rs 5,006 crores in FY25. We have achieved the highest-ever sustenance sales this year, growing by 22% y-o-y, driven by strong absorption in ongoing projects\u201d. During FY25, Puravankara Group invested over Rs 1,300 crore to secure land with a total area of approx. 8 msft with estimatedpotential GDV of over Rs 13,000 crore. This has been the highest ever annual investment in land acquisition demonstrating our ability to grow sustainably. The firm launched \u2018Purva Panorama\u2019 in Thane, Mumbai, with a total development potential of 3 million sq. ft. with an estimated GDV of Rs 4,000 crore, commencing with Tower C, which covers 0.52 million sq. ft Live Events \u201cIn FY26, we have a strong launch pipeline of over 13 million sq. ft., comprising 9 million sq. ft. of new projects and 4 million sq. ft. of new phase launches. Projects with total area of 5 million sq.ft are at advanced stages of securing approvals and expected to go live within the next two quarters,\u201d he said. India's economic landscape in Q4FY25 is marked by cautious optimism. Moody's Analytics has revised the 2025 GDP growth forecast downward to 6.1%, attributing the change to potential impacts from recent U.S. tariffs on Indian exports. In response, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has adopted an accommodative stance, reducing the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.00% in April 2025, with indications of further cuts to stimulate domestic demand. The real estate sector remains resilient, with residential sales reaching a 12-year high of 3,50,612 units in CY24, a 6.5% y-o-y increase, driven largely by premium housing homes priced above Rs 1 crore accounting for 46% of H2 sales as per Knight Frank Q1 2025 data.

S&P 500 futures were down by 0.2% after a brief 0.4% rise earlier, reflecting continued uncertainty about the administration\u2019s tariff strategy. Meanwhile, in Europe, stocks pushed higher after Trump hinted at a potential pause in auto tariffs. The US stock market faces mixed sentiment, as investors weigh trade developments alongside corporate earnings reports from big banks and tech companies. Agencies US stock market today: Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures edge lower as earnings season gains momentum and traders eye ongoing trade developments for market direction U.S. stock market futures slipped slightly early Tuesday after a strong two-day rally driven by tech stocks and temporary relief on tariff concerns. Investors are now shifting focus to corporate earnings as big names like Bank of America, Johnson & Johnson, and Citigroup reveal their first-quarter results. As of early trading: Dow Jones futures dipped 143 points, or 0.3% S&P 500 futures fell 0.2% Nasdaq-100 futures also shed 0.2% This comes after the S&P 500 posted back-to-back gains and the Dow Jones surged more than 300 points on Monday, helped by easing tech-sector worries. Key Takeaways Boeing stock drops nearly 4% after China halts jet deliveries amid escalating US-China trade tensions. Bank of America posts strong Q1 results, with a 9% rise in trading revenue. President Trump suggests a pause in auto tariffs , but uncertainty remains over future trade moves. Big Tech companies like Apple stand to benefit from temporary tariff exemptions, easing some pressure in the sector. Investors will focus on earnings reports and economic data this week to gauge market direction. What\u2019s moving the stock market today? The biggest catalyst behind Monday\u2019s rally was news from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection that certain electronics \u2014 including smartphones, computers, and semiconductors \u2014 would be exempt from President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs. Live Events That gave a notable lift to tech giants like Apple and Nvidia, pushing all three major indexes higher. However, comments from Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Sunday hinted the exemptions might be short-lived, keeping some investors cautious. What\u2019s behind the fluctuation in stock futures? The initial gains in stock futures were driven by optimism over potential tariff exemptions that could ease the economic burden caused by the ongoing trade war. Trump suggested that some industries, including auto manufacturers , may see a break from higher tariffs, sparking investor interest. However, the mood quickly shifted as investors grappled with the president's simultaneous push to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports . The ambiguity surrounding Trump\u2019s trade strategy continues to create market volatility, keeping traders cautious. How is Boeing affected by the trade war? Boeing (BA) saw its stock drop by almost 4% in premarket trading following reports that China had ordered airlines to halt further deliveries of Boeing jets. This development represents a direct consequence of the escalating US-China trade war. The suspension of deliveries is a significant blow to Boeing, especially as the company relies heavily on international sales, with China being one of its largest customers. Analysts are now closely watching whether this development will lead to more widespread disruptions for the aerospace sector and impact global supply chains. Which companies are making headlines in early trading? Bank of America (BAC) stock rose more than 1% premarket after reporting a solid beat in Q1: Earnings: $0.90 per share vs. $0.82 expected Revenue: $27.51 billion vs. $26.99 billion expected Citigroup (C) also topped Wall Street forecasts: Earnings: $1.96 per share vs. $1.85 expected Revenue: $21.60 billion vs. $21.29 billion expected Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) posted a Q1 beat but saw its shares tick slightly lower: Earnings: $2.77 per share vs. $2.59 expected Revenue: $21.89 billion vs. $21.56 billion expected Despite solid numbers, investor reactions were muted \u2014 reflecting lingering uncertainty over the broader market\u2019s direction amid geopolitical and trade noise. What economic reports are investors watching? Markets are also reacting to fresh economic data, including: Import and export price indexes for March Empire State Manufacturing Survey from the New York Federal Reserve These reports are being closely monitored to get a sense of inflation trends and industrial health, which may impact future Fed rate decisions. What are analysts saying about the future of Big Tech? One key takeaway from the ongoing tariff developments is the growing importance of Big Tech in the US economy. Apple , Amazon , and other tech giants have benefited from temporary tariff exemptions on consumer electronics, networking equipment, and semiconductors. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives emphasized that these exemptions are a positive development for tech companies, offering some breathing room amid escalating trade tensions with China. This provides a temporary reprieve for the sector, which has been one of the hardest-hit by the tariff war. Given the strategic importance of Big Tech to the US economy, many analysts believe the sector may be shielded from the worst of the tariff disruptions. How are global markets performing today? Overseas markets showed mixed signals on Tuesday, mostly following Wall Street's Monday rally. Here\u2019s how Asia-Pacific markets closed: Nikkei 225 (Japan): +0.84% to 34,267.54 Topix Index: +1% to 2,513.35 Kospi (South Korea): +0.88% to 2,477.41 Kosdaq: +0.41% to 711.92 S&P/ASX 200 (Australia): +0.17% to 7,761.70 Hang Seng (Hong Kong): +0.23% to 21,466.27 CSI 300 (China): flat at 3,761.23 Nifty 50 (India): +2.18% BSE Sensex (India): +2.19% These gains came after a tech-driven surge on Wall Street, although China\u2019s market remained flat, reflecting caution amid ongoing trade concerns. What\u2019s next for the stock market this week? While Monday\u2019s tech-led rebound provided some relief, uncertainty around tariff policy, the Federal Reserve\u2019s next move, and company earnings guidance still weigh on market sentiment. \u201cWe\u2019re likely to hear more questions than answers this earnings season ,\u201d said Brenda Vingiello, CIO at Sand Hill Global Advisors, on CNBC. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty for companies about how they\u2019ll be affected by Trump\u2019s new tariff decisions.\u201d Major earnings on deck include Netflix and United Airlines, which could set the tone for the rest of the week.

Read Today's Paper Indian carriers to fly world's youngest fleet in 5 years, become least emitter: Industry leaders SECTIONS Indian carriers to fly world's youngest fleet in 5 years, become least emitter: Industry leaders PTI Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 05:51:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Indian aviation is poised to operate the world's youngest fleet within five years, significantly reducing its carbon footprint, according to industry leaders at the India Travel & Tourism Sustainability Conclave 2025. Akasa Air's Aditya Ghosh highlighted that this transition would make India one of the lowest emitters in the sector. ANI Indian carriers will be flying the youngest fleet in the world in the next five years and become the least emitters from being the third largest emitter now, top aviation industry leaders said on Wednesday. Participating in a discussion at the India Travel & Tourism Sustainability Conclave 2025, Akasa Air Co-Founder Aditya Ghosh said, \"Five years from now, I definitely feel when you compare Indian aviation to the rest of the world we will be flying the youngest feet in the sky, which basically means, by math, that we will be actually emitting the least.\" He further said, \"If you look at aircraft orders and what people will be flying, you know, 2,000 days from now, we will, as a country, be flying the youngest, virtually, the youngest fleet in the world.\" Stating that at present India is the third largest aviation market in the world, Ghosh said, \"We're also the third largest emitter. Today, aviation contributes to 1 per cent of emissions in India, which is less than the global average.\" He, however, said that as the country's aviation sector grows, emissions will also grow at a faster pace. SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh said, \"India is going to be right at the forefront of being one of the lowest emitters in the world in the aviation sector.\" Live Events \"Aviation is going to be one of the most exciting areas in the Indian economy, there is no doubt. There is going to be rapid growth, more and more people are going to fly different modes of flight as well, not just aircraft.\" Expressing similar views, Air India Express Managing Director, Aloke Singh said before the merger of AirAsia India and Air India Express in FY23, just 10 per cent of the fleet was new generation. \"We closed the last financial year with 50:50 -- 50 per cent new gen and 50 per cent old. Next year two-thirds will be new gen. So that is rapidly moving,\" he said, however, adding sustainability is way wider than just fuel, including positively impacting society and embracing the circular economy, among others. Being a part of the Tata Group, where sustainability is almost embedded in the DNA, he said, \"We look at sustainability with a much broader lens.\" (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel ) Read More News on spicejet Indian carriers youngest fleet least emitters aviation emissions Akasa Air (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Read Today's Paper Stage's set for live shows to outshine the silver screen SECTIONS Stage's set for live shows to outshine the silver screen By Rajesh Naidu , ET Bureau Last Updated: Apr 15, 2025, 09:44:00 AM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Live events in India are set for rapid growth, projected to reach \u20b916,700 crore in revenue, driven by ticket booking platforms and audience demand for premium experiences. Ticket sales surged significantly, with sponsorship revenues also climbing. This growth is fueled by digital penetration, affluent demographics, and a desire for real-world experiences, making live events an attractive investment. AP Representational Live events are projected to be the fastest-growing entertainment category over the next three years, with revenue growth rate expected to rise at a compound annual rate of 18.2% to Rs 16,700 crore\u2014outpacing filmed entertainment, which is estimated to grow at just 4.3% to Rs 21,300 crore, according to the latest FICCI-EY Media and Entertainment report . Filmed entertainment includes box office, satellite and digital rights, international theatricals and in-cinema advertising. One of the key factors fuelling demand for live events is the emergence of ticket booking websites. These websites have made the economics of live events favourable for organisers in recent years. \u201cAvailability of ticket-booking websites has brought about a big change. Today, a live event derives 60-70% of its total revenues from tickets and food & beverages (select locations). Sponsorship contributes, on average, 30-40% to total revenues of events,\u201d said Lalitt Gattani , co-founder, Showcraft Productions, a company known for organising musical concerts and political events. It is estimated that in 2024 there were 30,687 live events across 319 cities. This amounted to 18% growth when compared to 2023. In 2024, revenues from ticket sales grew by 40\u201350% year over year, while revenues from sponsorship grew by 30% in the same period. Live Events Generally speaking, live event is an umbrella term used for business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) events. These include sports, musical concerts, political and religious events, comedy shows, weddings, musical plays, and managed corporate events, among others. Sports and musical concerts attract larger audiences in B2C events, shared event organisers. \u201cToday, audiences seek premium entertainment experiences which are at par with global standards. This reflects a shift in their expectations. They are ready to invest in unique, high-quality events, said Anil Makhija, COO of Live Entertainment and Venues at BookMyShow. Digital or social media penetration has also contributed significantly in creating demand for live events. Various social media platforms are providing much-needed information required for exploring and discovering artists and their works. \u201cToday, we live in a global digital world. Audiences are exposed to artists across geographies. Audiences aged between 12 to 25 are taste-makers as they explore and identify artists. These artists discovered by taste-makers are followed by audiences who are taste-followers,\u201d explained Tarsame Mittal, a musical entrepreneur who has also managed more than sixty artists, including Arijit Singh, Badshah and Vishal-Shekhar. On average, live events require an investment of Rs 5-30 crore. They can generate a return on investments of 30%. Interestingly, in recent years, a favourable demographic for live events has emerged. India has 40\u201350 million affluent homes. Then, there is an increasing base of live events' audiences which has emerged thanks to the easy and convenient way of buying tickets digitally. These audi40\u201350 are keen on live and immersive experiences of niche and popular artists. Given this, tickets for live events are priced in the range of Rs 2000-Rs 100000, depending on how niche or widely appealing an artist is. \"Live events such as musical concerts offer premium, aspirational and assured-quality experiences, which enable higher monetary commitment. This is a great attraction about them,\" said Ashish Pherwani, leader, media & entertainment sector, EY India . Increasingly, screen fatigue (mobile, laptops, television) is another contributor to the growth in attendance for live events. Event organisers shared that audiences are looking for more 'real' experiences to deal with the mind-numbing virtual world experience. \u201cScreen fatigue is creating demand for live events as audiences want \u2018real\u2019 experiences. Live events are unique experiences, as they cannot be repeated,\u201d pointed out Sabaash Joseph, co-founder and director at Wizcraft Group. In recent years, demand for live events has also been boosted by the disappointing performance of films, the fear-of-missing-out-on-a-trend tendency among audiences and the government\u2019s push for a concert economy. A study by Bank of Baroda last year showed that in a year concerts in India could generate spending to the tune of Rs 6000-8000 crore. Apart from metros, the next level of growth in live events is likely to come from India\u2019s top 40 cities, which have a population of over one million each. Despite these favourable conditions, lack of proper infrastructure, venues and delays related to obtaining multiple licences for events remain a few key challenges for live events.

Ajay Singh, Chairman, said the airline aims to double its fleet in the next year. SpiceJet plans to reactivate grounded aircraft and add leased planes. The airline is also monitoring the impact of potential Boeing delivery disruptions in China. SpiceJet will explore opportunities to improve its position. ANI SpiceJet Domestic carrier SpiceJet's revival plan is \"going very well\" and the airline is on track to double its current fleet over the next 12 months, Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh said on Wednesday. In January, SpiceJet announced plans to bring back into operations 10 of its grounded aircraft, including four Boeing B737 Max, by mid-April. The airline had said it has added 10 planes to its fleet since October 2024 -- three grounded aircraft that were brought back into service and seven inducted on lease. SpiceJet had faced multiple headwinds, including financial woes and legal disputes with lessors. In recent months, the carrier has raised funds and is on the revival path. Asked about SpiceJet's revival plan, Singh said, \"It is going very well and by this time next year we expect to have doubled our current fleet and this return to service program that we have, all the aircraft that are on the ground, yet we are doing our very best, seems to be on track and by the next 12 months, we will be double of where we currently are. The company is doing well and reviving quite nicely\". He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a travel conclave here. Live Events As on January 10, of the total 62 aircraft in fleet, SpiceJet had 28 aircraft in operations, comprising 20 B737, six De Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 and two Airbus A320. Besides, when asked about impact of China's reported ban on deliveries of Boeing aircraft to its carriers in the ongoing tariff war with the US, the SpiceJet CMD said, \"We will discuss with the manufacturers and see how best we can improve our own situation. We don't know what the situation is. How many aircraft were being delivered to China and what will happen to those aircraft\".

This review comes amid concerns raised by the Airline Pilots' Association of India regarding pilot welfare, mental health, and demanding working conditions. Revised duty and rest hour norms for pilots are scheduled for phased implementation starting July 1. ANI Representational image Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) is likely to review the existing framework for pilot fitness and response system at airports in an instance of a medical emergency. This comes amid the death of an Air India Express pilot soon after operating a flight from Srinagar due to a medical condition in Delhi earlier this month. The pilot, who operated the flight from Srinagar to Delhi was not feeling well after landing at the Delhi airport. He was taken to the hospital but died there, an official told PTI. The DGCA is likely to review the Standard Operating Procedure pilot fitness and response system at airports. Last week, the Airline Pilots' Association of India (ALPA) said there is an immediate need to place transparent regulations that prioritise rest for pilots, safety and humane scheduling practices. ALPA, which claims to represent around 800 pilots of various domestic airlines, is part of the International Federation of Airline Pilots' Association (IFALPA). Live Events The association had added that the unfortunate death of the Air India Express pilot raised serious questions about pilot welfare, mental health, and working conditions in the Indian aviation industry. Further, the group had stressed the need for having comprehensive mental health support systems within airline organisations, not merely as checkboxes but as active, accessible, and stigma-free services. Meanwhile, airlines are set to implement the revised norms on duty and rest hours for pilots in a phased manner starting July 1 that will provide more rest hours for pilots.

Transport Minister Pankaj Singh clarified that there will be no ban on autos or any other vehicle category. Agencies Representational New Delhi: The Delhi government on Tuesday approved extension of its Electric Vehicle (EV) policy by three months and continuation of power subsidy in the national capital. The Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Rekha Gupta also approved the continuation of the existing power subsidy for four categories: domestic consumers, farmers, lawyers with chambers, and victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. At a press conference held at Delhi Secretariat later, Transport Minister Pankaj Singh said there will be no ban on autos or any other category of vehicles. Speaking to PTI, he said, \"There are many things the government wants to do for its residents, and we will incorporate those in the revised EV policy. However, I want to make it clear that there will be no ban on autos, nor is there any proposal to ban any category of vehicles. The current EV policy is expected to continue for approximately the next three to four months.\" EV calculator How much will I save if I choose an electric vehicle?

Aircraft originally intended for Chinese carriers, including B737 MAX and B787s, could be redirected to Indian buyers. AI Express and Akasa previously acquired white tail aircraft and may secure more, easing fleet shortages caused by global supply chain disruptions. China grounds Boeing jet orders in fiery response to Trump tariffs Indian carriers, which are grappling with aircraft acquisition amid global supply chain limitations, are likely to benefit from China's instruction to its airlines to refrain from procuring Boeing aircraft in response to US President Donald Trump's 145% tariffs. Chinese airlines are currently awaiting delivery of around 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets \u2014 the same model ordered by Air India Express and Akasa \u2014 along with 11 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are also part of Air India\u2019s purchase list. \"We anticipate some of these aircraft, originally destined for Chinese carriers, will be redirected to Indian customers. The previous year or two witnessed a similar occurrence, with white tails (aircraft manufactured for specific customers but acquired by others) being allocated to AI Express and Akasa,\" airline industry specialists told TOI. AI Express acquired 25 white tail MAX last year and was scheduled to receive 25 additional aircraft. Following the recent US-China tariff dispute, the airline might secure additional white tails or purpose-built aircraft. \"The Seattle final assembly line capacity designated for Chinese carriers' MAX production will now remain unutilised. Consequently, Indian carriers including AI Express and Akasa might receive additional aircraft, either specifically manufactured or white tails,\" industry sources said. Regarding Airbus, it maintains two final assembly lines for the prominent single-aisle A320 family. China may now request Airbus to increase aircraft availability for its carriers. Boeing's delivery delays Boeing's delayed aircraft deliveries have significantly impacted India's newest carrier Akasa, as it currently employs substantially more pilots than its present or anticipated near-term requirements, causing dissatisfaction among idle cockpit crew. Both Tata group Air India Express and Akasa possess sufficient financial capability to accommodate additional aircraft, if available at present. These budget airlines incorporated white tails featuring several rows of 2x2 business seating arrangements frontward, as specified by the original customer. They accepted available aircraft from Boeing, whose MAX production has been considerably affected following successive unfavourable developments. Live Events US-China trade war reaches skies The global aerospace industry is being dragged into a U.S.-led trade war, with planemakers, airlines and suppliers reviewing contracts worth billions of dollars, after U.S. supplier Howmet Aerospace ignited debate over who should bear the cost of the tariffs. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline CEOs saying they would defer delivery of planes rather than pay duties. China's top three airlines - Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines - had planned to take delivery of 45, 53 and 81 Boeing planes respectively between 2025 and 2027. Beijing has also asked that Chinese carriers halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from U.S. companies, the Bloomberg report said. Two aerospace industry sources told Reuters they had not been alerted independently to a blanket ban by China on U.S. aircraft parts. Analysts said a short-term halt in deliveries to China would not have a major impact on Boeing, since the planemaker could redirect those jets to other airlines and because Airbus does not have capacity to supply the country alone. China would have more difficulty banning imports of new U.S. parts to support its existing fleet of aircraft, including China\u2019s C919. \u201cIf China stops buying aircraft components from the US, the C919 program is halted or dead,\u201d wrote Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein in a note to clients. The Chinese government is considering ways to provide assistance to airlines that lease Boeing jets and are facing higher costs, Bloomberg News reported. It was China that first grounded Boeing's 737 MAX jets after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed nearly 350 people. China also suspended most orders and deliveries of the jet in 2019. Beijing's action follows its decision last week to hike levies on U.S. imports to 125% in retaliation against U.S. tariffs, which would significantly raise the cost of Boeing jets bound for Chinese carriers and potentially lead airlines to consider alternatives such as Airbus and domestic player COMAC. The escalating tit-for-tat tariffs between the world's two biggest economies risk bringing goods trade between the two countries to a standstill. That trade was valued at over $650 billion in 2024.

This acquisition, facilitated through the green channel route, allows Patanjali Ayurved to become Magma General Insurance's promoter. Agencies Representational New Delhi: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has cleared a proposal of Patanjali Ayurved and five other entities to acquire a majority stake in Magma General Insurance . \"The proposed combination is being notified under the green channel route in consonance with section 6(4) of the Competition Act, 2002,\" CCI said in a notice. Under the green channel route, a transaction which does not pose any risk of an appreciable adverse effect on competition is deemed to be approved on being intimated to the competition watchdog. Apart from Patanjali Ayurved, the entities participating in the transaction are S R Foundation, Riti Foundation, RR Foundation, Suruchi Foundation and Swati Foundation. \"The acquirers propose to acquire 98.055 per cent shareholding of the target (Magma General Insurance Ltd) on a fully diluted basis by way of share purchase,\" a notice submitted to the CCI said on Tuesday. Yoga guru Baba Ramdev 's Patanjali Ayurved Ltd (PAL) is engaged in manufacturing and marketing of herbal nature-based products, medicines and other fast moving consumer goods. Live Events The foundations, on their part, view the deal as a compelling investment to diversify into a rapidly growing market segment. They aim to expand their footprints into new sectors to create a diversified business portfolio. Following the CCI approval, Patanjali Ayurved will assume the role of Magma General Insurance's promoter entity. This will further diversify Patanjali's portfolio, which currently focuses on healthcare and FMCG. \"The activities of the parties (including their affiliates) do not exhibit any horizontal overlaps, vertical relationships, or complementary linkages in any of the plausible relevant markets in India,\" the notice said.

Read Today's Paper Credit rating upgrade to boost Voda Idea Rs 25,000 crore debt raising efforts: Citi SECTIONS Credit rating upgrade to boost Voda Idea Rs 25,000 crore debt raising efforts: Citi ET Bureau Last Updated: Apr 14, 2025, 01:08:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Vodafone Idea's credit rating has improved to investment grade BBB- following the government's debt conversion, potentially aiding its Rs 25,000 crore debt raise. Citi Research suggests this upgrade is a significant boost, fulfilling a key requirement for bank lending. Successful funding would also benefit Indus Towers by alleviating concerns about Vodafone Idea's financial stability and future tenancies. Agencies NEW DELHI: Vodafone Idea \u2019s improved credit rating to an investment grade BBB- post the government\u2019s conversion of Rs 36,950 crore statutory debt into equity could boost the loss-making telco\u2019s prospects of concluding its pending Rs 25,000 crore debt raise, Citi Research said in a report. \u201cThe investment-grade credit rating should, in our view, provide a meaningful boost to VI\u2019s efforts to complete its long-delayed bank debt raise, as this is typically one of the key requirements for banks to provide lending,\u201d Citi Research said. \u201cWe believe the recent equity conversion by the government and the subsequent credit rating upgrade to investment-grade are two material positives for VI, increasing the likelihood of the company completing its pending Rs25000 crore debt raise,\u201d the brokerage house said. It added that a successful fund raise would also be a key catalyst for Indus Towers by lifting concerns surrounding new tenancies from VI and its future cash flow situation. The brokerage said that following the recent equity conversion, VI\u2019s annual dues to the government (spectrum + adjusted gross revenue) over FY26, FY27 and FY28E stand reduced to around Rs19000 crore, Rs 23000 crore and Rs 32000 crore from around Rs30000 crore, Rs 43000 crore and 43000 crore, respectively. Live Events \u201cAssuming VI were to succeed in closing out its Rs25000 crore bank debt funding, which is crucial for the company\u2019s planned capex, we estimate no cash shortfall in FY26E but a potential shortfall in FY27E (primarily due to the high AGR amount payable of Rs16500 crore per annum). VI remains in discussions with the government for potential relief on the latter,\u201d Citi Research said. On Friday, ratings agency ICRA Ltd assigned an improved BBB- credit rating to Vi\u2019s long-term fund facilities, compared to the previous BB+ assigned by CARE Ratings in June 2024. \u201cWith the company now coming back into the investment grade rating, which is the requirement for the banks to provide funding, the debt funding discussions should now progress in the right direction,\u201d a Vi spokesperson said in a written response to ET. Raising debt from banks is critical for Vi to execute its Rs 50,000-55,000 crore capex plans over the next three years for expanding 4G operations in priority circles and rolling out 5G in key cities. The telco needs to quickly expand its 4G services as it looks to narrow network coverage gaps with bigger rivals Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel , and arrest customer losses. Global ratings agency, Fitch, says on its website that `BBB\u2019 ratings indicate that the expectations of default risk are low and the capacity for payment of financial commitments is adequate. Earlier this month, the government decided to convert Rs 36,950 crore of Vi\u2019s outstanding spectrum dues into equity shares, which will increase its stake in the telco to around 49% from 22.6% previously. Subsequently, Vi\u2019s board also cleared the conversion of these spectrum dues into equity. Till now, it has raised Rs 26,000 crore in equity.

Read Today's Paper Govt cut cheaper APM gas supply to CNG retailers IGL, MGL, Adani Total Gas SECTIONS Govt cut cheaper APM gas supply to CNG retailers IGL, MGL, Adani Total Gas PTI Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 05:04:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis The government has decreased the supply of lower-cost APM gas to city gas distributors like Indraprastha Gas Ltd by up to 20%, substituting it with more expensive fuel. This reduction in APM gas allocation, effective April 16, 2025, will lead to higher input costs for CGD companies, potentially resulting in CNG price hikes and impacting profitability. Agencies Several brokerages have shown optimism about the recent amendments proposed by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) The government has cut the supply of lower-cost APM gas to city gas distributors such as Indraprastha Gas Ltd , Mahanagar Gas Ltd , and Adani Total Gas Ltd , by up to 20 per cent, replacing the shortfall with more expensive fuel. GAIL (India) Ltd, the state-owned nodal agency for gas supply, has intimated about a cut in supply of gas from legacy fields, called Administered Price Mechanism (APM) gas, the three city retailers said in separate stock exchange filings. The production of APM gas, which is currently priced at USD 6.75 per million British thermal unit, is declining at the rate of 9-10 per cent annually as recovery from old and ageing fields falls. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is investing in drilling more wells to maintain the output, but that additional cost is reflected in a higher price of the gas thus produced. Such gas is called new well gas and is priced at about USD 8 per mmBtu. In the last one year, APM gas supplies to city gas retailers have been cut by almost 50 per cent. With the latest cut, the APM gas now meets about 34 per cent of the total city gas requirement, down from 51 per cent previously. Live Events IGL, the firm that retails CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households in the national capital and adjoining cities, stated in its regulatory filing that it gets \"domestic gas allocation for meeting the requirement of piped natural gas (to household kitchens) and CNG sales volumes at the pricing fixed by the government (presently at USD 6.75 per MMbtu).\" \"Based on communication received by the company from GAIL (India) Ltd (the nodal agency for domestic gas allocation), this is to inform that there has been a reduction in domestic gas allocation to the company effective from April 16, 2025. The revised domestic gas allocation to the company is approximately 20 per cent lesser than previous allocation,\" IGL said, adding that it has been allocated an additional 125 per cent of the reduction in domestic gas volumes as New Well Gas (NWG), which is priced at 12 per cent of Indian Crude Basket. This, it said, is expected to impact the profitability of the company. MGL, the city gas retailer in Mumbai, said as per Policy Guideline dated August 10, 2022, issued by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, domestically produced Administrative Price Mechanisms (APM) natural gas is to be allocated to City Gas Distribution (CGD) companies for priority segments, specifically domestic Piped Natural Gas supplies (PNG) to household kitchens for cooking and CNG (Transport). The policy states that the supply of domestic gas to CGD entities will be made only up to the quantity available and allocated to GAIL for these segments. \"In line with this policy, the company was allocated APM natural gas for Domestic PNG and CNG (Transport) based on APM gas availability. Allocation of APM to the company has been reduced by 18 per cent, effective April 16, 2025, compared to the previous fortnight APM allocation,\" MGL said. \"Reduction of APM volume has been replaced with New Well/Well Intervention gas (NWG). This will have an adverse impact on the profitability, however, the company is in the process of exploring all measures to mitigate the impact.\" Adani Total Gas Ltd , the equal joint venture of Adani Group and TotalEnergies of France, said it has been informed by GAIL \"for a reduction of APM gas allocation by 15 per cent.\" \"This lower allocation of APM gas is being replaced with New Well Gas,\" it said. \"However, the higher-priced NWG and lower APM gas allocation will have an adverse impact on the profitability of the company. The company is exploring all measures to mitigate the impact,\" it added. The cut in APM gas allocation translates into higher input costs for CGD companies, which could result in another CNG price hike by the companies.

A statement from the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) said it was observed that sometimes the total penalty exceeds the original tax amount, and property owners then delay paying up. ''The government has decided to waive the penalty, and the existing laws related to municipal councils, nagar panchayats and industrial townships will be amended to introduce this amnesty scheme,\" said an official statement. Another amendment will authorise the members of municipal councils, nagar panchayats and industrial townships to remove their respective presidents from their posts. Earlier, at least 50 per cent of the members had to submit a resolution to the district collector seeking the removal of the president of a municipal council, and the government then took necessary action. With the new amendment, the members will have the powers to remove a council president. ''Two thirds of the elected members will send the proposal with signatures, after which the district collector will convene a special session of the local body in ten days and a voting will be held. The cabinet approved the amendment and issuance of an ordinance for the same (as the state legislature is not in session at present),\" said the CMO release. Live Events In another decision, the cabinet approved the proposal to bring in a new legislation to provide that the rate of interest for a delay in the payment of compensation for land acquisition will be uniform and one per cent higher than the prevailing bank repo rate . Under the Land Acquisition Act of 2013, the rate of interest is 12 percent, 9 per cent and 15 per cent under different clauses. It puts a financial burden on the state exchequer and increases the project cost, said the release. As per the proposed amendment, the interest rate will be uniform, and set at one percent above the repo rate.

Read Today's Paper SOPA urges delay on soybean stock sale to protect prices ahead of kharif sowing SECTIONS SOPA urges delay on soybean stock sale to protect prices ahead of kharif sowing By Sutanuka Ghosal , ET Bureau Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 03:47:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis The Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA) has urged the Union Agriculture Ministry to further delay the sale of soybean stocks by NAFED and NCCF until after the kharif sowing season concludes. SOPA fears that releasing the stock prematurely will depress prices, harming farmers and causing losses for the government, reversing the positive price movement seen after the initial postponement. Agencies The Soybean Processors Association of India ( SOPA ) has urged the Union Agriculture Ministry not to allow National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India ( NAFED ) and National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF) to offload their soyabean stock before the kharif sowing of the crop is over. Earlier, the government had agreed to SOPA\u2019s request for stopping the sale of soybeans in the open market by NAFED and NCCF to support soybean prices, which have fallen much below the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for almost the entire current season. This move caused upward movement in soybean prices, which increased by almost Rs 4000 per ton after the announcement that NAFED will not be selling the stock before the sowing starts in June this year. We were expecting that the prices would recover further in the next two months, said SOPA in a media release issued today. The decision to postpone the sale till June has been beneficial to all concerned, the farmers are getting a higher price, the sowing of soybean which was feared to fall because of low prices will now be normal and above all, NAFED and NCCF, who were incurring a loss of almost Rs 15000 per ton, would be getting a much higher price, reducing their losses substantially, the release added. \u201cWe now understand that NAFED and NCCF are again preparing to offload their socks in the open market through tender. As a result of this move, the soybean prices have started falling again. We would again reiterate that selling soybeans before the sowing has ended sometime in June end, will be disastrous for all concerned and will cause heavy losses to the government and discourage the farmers. We would request that soybean stocks held by NAFD and NCCF may be sold only after the sowing has been completed,\u201d the SOPA release said.

Light commercial vehicles will lead, driven by e-commerce expansion, while government initiatives like the PM-eBus Sewa scheme will boost electric vehicle adoption. Agencies India\u2019s domestic commercial vehicle (CV) sales are expected to reach nearly one million units in the current financial year, driven by improved infrastructure activity, rising replacement demand, and policy support under the PM-eBus Sewa scheme . The expected volumes would mark a return to the peak levels recorded in fiscal 2019, before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. According to a Crisil Ratings analysis covering four major CV manufacturers, together accounting for about 70% of sector volumes, the industry is poised for a 3-5% growth in total domestic volumes. This follows a slowdown in the previous year and signals a return to the long-term growth trend. Light commercial vehicles (LCVs), which make up around 62% of the total CV volumes, are expected to lead the charge. Demand in this segment is being lifted by the expanding presence of e-commerce platforms and the growth of warehousing, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. In contrast, medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs), which contribute roughly 38% to overall volume, are projected to grow by 2-4% this fiscal. This growth will be propelled by sustained government investment in infrastructure, particularly in construction, roads, and metro-rail projects. \u201cDomestic CV volume should grow 3-5% this fiscal, rebounding from last fiscal\u2019s slowdown and aligning with the sector\u2019s long-term growth trend,\u201d said Anuj Sethi, Senior Director, Crisil Ratings Ltd. \u201cThe recovery will be driven by a revival in infrastructure execution \u2013 an anchor for CV demand \u2013 which gained momentum in the last quarter of fiscal 2025 and is likely to sustain on the back of a 10-11% rise in central government capex. A strong replacement cycle, expected to account for about a fifth of the volume, will further support demand.\u201d Another factor likely to support growth is the replacement demand from ageing vehicles, particularly those purchased during fiscals 2017 to 2019. This trend is being supported by easing inflation and interest rates, encouraging fleet upgrades that had previously been deferred. Live Events In the electric segment, the government-backed PM-eBus Sewa scheme is expected to stimulate sales of electric buses, although from a small base of around 3,200 units. The scheme is being seen as a catalyst for long-term growth in electric CVs. While demand conditions improve, regulatory changes will also begin to reshape the industry. From October 2025, trucks will be required to have air-conditioned cabins \u2014 a move that is expected to raise vehicle costs by at least \u20b930,000 per unit, especially for M&HCVs. Anticipating these regulatory expenses, CV manufacturers raised prices by 2-3% in January to partially offset the cost impact. \u201cWith regulatory costs rising, CV makers are likely to continue selective price hikes to protect margins at 11-12%,\u201d said Poonam Upadhyay, Director, Crisil Ratings Ltd. \u201cMeanwhile, capex is set to rise, with leading players planning spends worth ~Rs 4,500 crore this fiscal toward safety upgrades, emission compliance, and electric vehicle platforms. This reflects a clear shift towards regulatory and tech-led investment. Yet the capex-to-Ebitda will stay below 0.3 time.\u201d Operating margins are expected to stay at 11-12%, in line with the decade-high level achieved last fiscal, aided by the softening of input costs. Although capital expenditure is projected to rise by 12-15% this year, manufacturers\u2019 healthy cash flows will allow them to absorb the investment without adding significant debt. The credit outlook for the sector remains stable, supported by strong liquidity and robust cash flow generation. Key financial ratios such as debt-to-Ebitda are forecast to remain around 1 time, and interest coverage ratio is expected to stay at approximately 10 times, similar to the previous year. This reflects a healthy debt-servicing position for major players in the industry. That said, the overall demand recovery will remain sensitive to the direction of interest rates and inflation trends in the months ahead.

Dart\u2019s comment was caught on microphone and sparked social media outrage. Following a loss, she issued a sincere apology. Boisson responded humorously, photoshopping a Dove deodorant can into her photo, winning over fans with her witty reaction. During a tennis match at the Open de Rouen, Harriet Dart's (left) on-court complaint about opponent Lois Boisson's (right) odor sparked controversy. In what may go down as one of the more unexpected\u2014and undeniably pungent\u2014moments in professional tennis, British star Harriet Dart served up not just shots but shade during her match against French player Lois Boisson at the Open de Rouen on April 15. Midway through the clash, Dart stunned onlookers with a request to the chair umpire that wasn\u2019t about a line call or a time violation. \u201cCan you tell her to wear deodorant? She\u2019s smelling really bad,\u201d she muttered\u2014loud enough for courtside mics to pick up, and for the internet to do the rest. From Backhand to Backlash Social media didn't hold back, launching a volley of criticism at the British No. 4 for what many called a \u201cnasty\u201d and \u201carrogant\u201d comment. Critics pointed out the irony: Dart\u2019s game, not her opponent\u2019s scent, was what really stank that day. She lost the match 6-0, 6-3\u2014a scoreline as brutal as her insult\u2014and quickly realized she may have served herself into a PR fault. \u2014 TheTennisLetter (@TheTennisLetter) Apology, Ace\u2019d Not long after the backlash, Dart took to Instagram with a formal apology, calling the incident a \u201cheat-of-the-moment comment\u201d that she \u201ctruly regrets.\u201d She assured fans that it wasn\u2019t how she wished to conduct herself and added that she held \u201ca lot of respect for Lois.\u201d The tennis world may forgive a missed serve, but foul play in words? That\u2019s harder to shake off. \u2014 TheTennisLetter (@TheTennisLetter) Lois Boisson\u2019s Deodorant Drop Mic While Dart's apology tried to smooth things over, it was Lois Boisson who stole the show\u2014and the internet. Taking the high road with a heavy dose of humor, the 21-year-old posted a picture from the match on Instagram, photoshopping a Dove deodorant can into her racket hand. Her cheeky caption? \"@dove apparently need a collab,\" complete with a prayer emoji and a pair of laughing faces. Social media erupted in praise, calling her response \"classy,\" \"smart,\" and a \"mic-drop moment\" worthy of a Grand Slam itself. \u2014 TheTennisLetter (@TheTennisLetter) Net Gains and New Fans Boisson\u2019s swift and witty comeback not only earned her the match, but also a surge of new fans and potentially, a brand deal. Fans rallied behind her with cries of \u201cOutstanding!\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s the drama I love on the WTA.\u201d Some even began tagging Dove in droves, campaigning for the most unexpectedly iconic endorsement in tennis history.

'My dad is Vinod Khanna' While Dart has seen highs like Wimbledon third rounds and Billie Jean King Cup glory, this moment may serve as a career footnote she didn\u2019t bargain for. On the other side, Boisson\u2014ranked 303 and just getting her 2024 WTA Tour started\u2014walked away with a win on the court and off it. Turns out, when it comes to grace under pressure and a well-timed joke, the real deodorant champion is clear.

ONGC emerged as the dominant winner, acquiring 15 blocks, while Vedanta secured seven. This round witnessed significant investment commitments and aims to boost India's oil and gas production, reducing the nation's reliance on imports. Reuters Representative image Reliance Industries , global energy giant BP and state-owned ONGC, which for the first time ever teamed together for any venture, won a Gujarat offshore oil block in the latest bid round that saw ONGC walk away with most areas and Vedanta winning seven. The consortia of Reliance, BP and ONGC won the GS-OSHP-2022/2 block that was offered under the ninth bid round of the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP-IX). State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and its partners won 15 blocks. The state-owned firm won 11 blocks on its own and the remaining four with partners. Mining baron Anil Agarwal's Vedanta, which had bid for all the 28 blocks on offer, won 7, officials said. \"We are happy to confirm that we have signed a contract for a new exploration license under the consortium of ONGC (40 per cent) RIL (30 per cent) and bp (30 per cent) for block GS-OSHP-2022/2 (Saurashtra Basin) in the OALP IX bidding round. \"This strategic collaboration brings together the expertise of India's largest national oil and gas company, ONGC, the largest Indian conglomerate, Reliance Industries, and global energy major bp. This consortium leverages the strength of all parties and is another step towards strengthening India's energy security goals,\" a BP spokesperson said. Live Events Oil India Ltd won 6 blocks on its own and 3 in a joint venture with ONGC. Contracts for the OALP-IX blocks were signed at an event here in the presence of Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri. In the OALP-IX bid round, 28 blocks or areas spread over 1.36 lakh square kilometres were offered for finding and producing oil and gas. The highlight of the round was Reliance-BP combine bidding together with ONGC for one block in Gujarat offshore. Reliance and its supermajor partner BP Plc had bid in just two of the past eight oil and gas bid rounds since 2017. They had won both the blocks. In the previous eighth round of the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP-VIII), ONGC had not bid for the ultra deepsea Krishna Godavari basin block that Reliance-bp combine had sought. Pallavi Jain, Director General of DGH, said a USD 3.77 billion investment has been committed in the previous eight bid rounds of OALP. At the close of bidding for OLAP-IX on September 21, 2024, ONGC bid for 14 blocks alone and with partners such as state-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) for four other blocks. After considering its bid with Reliance-BP, ONGC in all bid for 19 out of the 28 blocks on offer. Vedanta bid for all the 28 blocks on offer, while Sun Petrochemicals Ltd bid for seven areas. Of the 28 blocks on offer, four blocks got three bids each, while the rest had two bidders, one being Vedanta Ltd. Blocks were awarded to firms offering the highest share of revenues generated from oil and gas produced from the blocks and the work programme they commit to, officials said. The government in February opened the OALP-X bid round, offering 25 blocks with an area of approximately 1,91,986.21 sq km. This is the biggest round ever and bidding closes on July 31. Out of 25 blocks, 6 blocks are on land, 6 in shallow water, 1 in deep water and 12 blocks are in ultra-deep-water areas. Of the 28 blocks offered in OALP-IX, nine were onshore blocks, eight shallow-water blocks and 11 ultra-deepwater blocks across eight sedimentary basins, with an area of 136,596.45 sq km. In the previous eight OALP rounds, 144 exploration and production blocks, comprising a total area of 242,055 sq km, have been awarded. In the last round (OALP-VIII), where 10 blocks were offered, state-owned ONGC won seven blocks, while Reliance-BP, Oil India and private-sector Sun Petrochemicals received one block each. The government introduced OALP in 2017 to attract oil and gas firms to develop India's upstream sector. The OALP guarantees marketing and pricing freedom with a revenue-sharing model, apart from offering reduced royalty rates. Reliance and BP have more than a decade-old partnership and are partners in KG deepsea block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 from where they produce about 28 million standard cubic meters per day of gas. The government has been hoping that opening up more acreage for exploration will help boost India's oil and gas production, helping cut down the USD 222 billion oil import bill. In 2016, it brought in an open acreage policy, which moved away from the previous practice of government identifying and bidding out blocks to one where explorers were allowed the freedom to identify any area outside of the ones that are already with some company or other for prospecting of oil and gas. The areas identified are to be clubbed twice a year and offered for bidding. The firm identifying the area gets a 5-point advantage. But except for the first round, private sector participation has been scant. Mining mogul Anil Agarwal's Vedanta Ltd walked away with 41 blocks out of the 55 blocks on offer in the very first round and got another 10 areas in two subsequent rounds. Other rounds have been dominated by state-owned firms.

This growth is largely fueled by popular cricket events like the IPL and ICC Champions Trophy, along with bundled offerings from telecom partners. The platform competes with global giants, offering diverse content and innovative streaming features. Agencies JioHotstar Streaming platform JioHotstar , owned by JioStar , has surpassed 200 million paid subscribers within two months of its launch\u2014marking a rapid growth milestone in the global streaming space. \u201cWe have crossed 200 million paying subscribers. That makes us one of the biggest streaming services anywhere in the world,\" Uday Shankar, vice chairman of JioStar, a joint venture between Reliance Industries , Walt Disney , and Bodhi Tree , told Bloomberg. This growth is attributed in large part to marquee cricket properties such as the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) and the ICC Champions Trophy. JioHotstar emerged following the merger of Disney+ Hotstar and JioCinema. According to industry sources, a significant share of the subscriber base came through bundled offerings with telecom partners, including Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea. The platform has also added a considerable number of direct subscribers. Launched on February 14, the merged platform began with 50 million paid subscribers. Since then, it has added 150 million more, reaching a total of 200 million. Live Events In March, JioHotstar crossed 100 million paid subscribers, reinforcing its status as India\u2019s leading streaming service. The platform competes with global giants like Netflix, Prime Video, and YouTube in India's hyper-competitive streaming industry. JioHotstar offers a wide array of content, including international series, Hollywood films, TV shows, regional specials, and original digital programming. On the sports front, it has introduced innovations such as 4K streaming, AI-powered features, and multi-angle viewing during major events like the IPL and ICC tournaments. Beyond sports, JioHotstar has been at the center of high-profile live-streamed moments in India, including the Coldplay concert and Mahashivratri celebrations.

Read Today's Paper Delhi HC seeks Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s response on RHC appeal over Fortis trademark sale SECTIONS Delhi HC seeks Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s response on RHC appeal over Fortis trademark sale By Indu Bhan , ET Bureau Last Updated: Apr 15, 2025, 09:27:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis The Delhi High Court is reviewing RHC Healthcare's challenge to the 'Fortis' trademark sale to Fortis Healthcare, alleging undervaluation. RHC seeks an independent valuation, claiming the Rs 200 crore sale was based on an erroneous report by Daiichi Sankyo. While the court didn't halt the sale, further actions regarding the Fortis brand are subject to the appeal's outcome. Agencies Fortis The division bench of the Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought response from Japanese pharma major Daiichi Sankyo Company Ltd on the RHC Healthcare Management Services' appeal challenging sale of its 'Fortis' trademark to Fortis Healthcare (FHL) at an \"undervalued price.\" RHC Healthcare Management wants the court to direct the valuation of the brand and mark Fortis through an independent court appointed valuer. It said that the brand Fortis was sold at an undervalued price in a public auction directed by the HC in October last year and the sale did not fetch the optimum price of the asset. FHL had in December last year acquired the \u2018Fortis\u2019 trademark for Rs 200 crore after a prolonged legal battle involving its former promoters - Malvinder and Shivinder Singh- their related entities, and the Japanese company. The trademarks were previously held by entities owned and controlled the erstwhile promoters of the company. RHC alleged that the brand was auctioned at a highly undervalued price of Rs 200 crore, based on the erroneous valuation report placed on record by Daiichi. It was incumbent upon the single judge to ensure that the optimum price of the asset was determine and fetched by directing an independent valuation prior to sale, the appeal stated. A DB led by Justice Saurabh Banerjee on Tuesday refused to interfere with the sale but observed that any further steps taken in respect of Fortis brand will be subject to the outcome of the RHC Healthcare\u2019s appeal. However, the court will hear the objections by Daiichi and Fortis Healthcare on the maintainability of the appeal on April 29. Live Events Daiichi is pursuing the enforcement of a Rs 3,500-crore arbitration award against the Singh brothers pronounced by a Singapore tribunal for concealing information when they sold Ranbaxy Laboratories to the Japanese company for $4.6 billion in 2008. Challenging the October 19, last year's single judge's order that allowed the execution application for sale of the Fortis trademark, RHC said that the sale was allowed without complying with the terms of the consent/offer and without determining a fair and an independent valuation to be conducted prior to the sale. Daiichi Sankyo had in January 2020 moved the HC seeking sale of \u201cFortis\u201d and allied trademarks and for appointment of a court commissioner for the purpose of conducting valuation and sale of the \u201cFortis\u201d brand. In September 2017 a KPMG valuation report had put the value of the Fortis brand between Rs 650 crore to Rs 750 crore while using the Royalty Relief Method . \u201cthe single judge failed to appreciate that the decree holder (Daichii) has deliberately grossly undervalued the valuation of the Brand and mark \"Fortis\" and has restricted the valuation by giving its own specific instructions and mandate to the valuer. It is apparent that the valuer was mindful of the fact that valuation being restricted is not reflective of the market value of the brand, whereby they have been able to arrive at a certain fixed value of Rs 191.5 crore as opposed to a range based on various factors\u2026\u201d the appeal stated.

This move signifies Walmart's growing investment in India's tech ecosystem, complementing its existing GCC in Bengaluru. Agencies Bengaluru: Walmart 's Indian technology arm has leased nearly 465,000 square feet of office space in Chennai for setting up its second global capability centre (GCC) in the country, enhancing the US retail giant's investment commitment in the country's robust tech ecosystem. WM Global Technology Services India Pvt Ltd rented the office space at the International Tech Park Chennai (ITPC). Located at ITPC's Block 1, the property was leased from Radial IT Park Pvt Ltd. It spans five floors with a chargeable area of 465,447 sq ft, showed the lease document shared by Propstack, a data analytics firm. The expansion follows Walmart leasing about 950,000 sq ft in Bengaluru in the December quarter from realty developer Prestige Group to set up its first GCC in India. \"The lease agreement begins on January 1, 2025, and spans a tenure of 60 months. The agreed rental rate is \u20b970 per sq ft per month, translating into a monthly rent of \u20b93.26 crore,\" the document showed. \"Walmart has also deposited a six-month rental amount as security, totalling approximately \u20b919.55 crore,\" it mentioned. Innovation Hub As per the agreement, the rent will escalate by 4% annually over the lease term. Live Events Experts say the addition of the Chennai centre reflects Walmart\u2019s strategy to build a strong pan-India tech presence. \u201cChennai\u2019s IT corridor has emerged as a prominent hub for GCCs due to the availability of skilled talent, well-developed infrastructure, and cost advantages. Walmart\u2019s decision to establish operations in ITPC further validates Chennai\u2019s growing prominence in the global tech landscape,\u201d a person said. India has become a pivotal part of Walmart\u2019s global tech strategy. The Chennai GCC will house teams working across critical technology functions that power Walmart\u2019s global retail ecosystem and can seat 4,500 employees. From data engineering and artificial intelligence to cloud computing and cybersecurity, the Chennai facility will serve as a key contributor to Walmart\u2019s innovation agenda. \u201cWith capability centres in both Bengaluru and Chennai, Walmart is positioning itself to leverage India not just as a back-office location but as a full-fledged innovation hub,\u201d said the person cited above. \u201cThis dual-city presence enhances agility, talent access, and operational resilience \u2014 cornerstones for the next phase of growth in a rapidly evolving global retail environment.\u201d Walmart\u2019s latest expansion underlines the growing importance of India in global retail-tech strategies and highlights how multinationals are increasingly integrating Indian talent into their core innovation and operational framework. These firms are increasingly leveraging India\u2019s deep talent pool by establishing their GCCs as strategic hubs or second headquarters, driving innovation, digital transformation, and high-value capabilities. Expansion into multi-functional centres, consolidation of existing operations, and the entry of new players are expected to fuel GCC-led leasing activity. Industry experts project GCCs will comprise about 40% of total office space absorption across India\u2019s top cities in 2025, said CBRE in its latest report.

Read Today's Paper India extends auction for deep-sea blocks containing critical minerals SECTIONS India extends auction for deep-sea blocks containing critical minerals Reuters Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 02:59:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis India has extended the auction deadline for deep-sea mineral blocks, crucial for electric vehicle batteries, to May 1, due to requests from companies seeking more time for block assessment. This move aims to encourage broader participation, despite opposition citing environmental concerns and protests from fishing communities. India seeks to secure critical minerals for its ambitious renewable energy goals. TIL Creatives Representative image India has extended an auction of deep-sea blocks containing critical minerals used in electric vehicle batteries and other products until May 1, a spokesperson at India's Ministry of Mines said on Wednesday. China is a top global producer of 30 of the 50 minerals considered critical by the U.S. Geological Survey, but has been curtailing exports recently amid trade tensions with the United States. India in November launched the first tranche of an auction of 13 offshore deep-sea mineral blocks, including three lime mud blocks, three construction sand blocks, and seven polymetallic nodule blocks. The blocks contain critical minerals including cobalt, copper, manganese, and nickel. An initial bid deadline of February 27 was bumped to April 2 and has been extended again, the ministry spokesperson confirmed. Live Events \"We have received queries from companies that want to study the blocks and have asked for time,\" a source told Reuters, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Another source said the move was aimed at encouraging wider participation from potential bidders. Opposition parties have called for the auction to be cancelled citing risks to the environment and local media have reported protests led by fishermen in the southern state of Kerala. Earlier this month, the mines minister in a written reply to parliament said the ministry had consulted the environment ministry, department of fisheries and others before launching the auction. India currently lacks the seabed mining expertise to extract minerals, experts say. Some Indian mining and cement companies have approached Dutch shipbuilder Royal IHC for technical assistance as they prepare to bid for deep-sea blocks, Reuters reported last month. New Delhi has also had limited success in its onshore critical minerals auction , with only about half of the 48 blocks awarded to bidders. Yet India is keen to accelerate seabed mineral exploration to boost the supply of raw materials critical for its energy transition. The world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, it aims to add 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2030, up from 165 GW currently, while aiming for net zero emissions by 2070.

Read Today's Paper Pay GST on society maintenance if monthly charge is more than this and annual collection is above Rs 20 lakh SECTIONS Pay GST on society maintenance if monthly charge is more than this and annual collection is above Rs 20 lakh By Neelanjit Das , ET Online Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 12:18:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis GST: Every homeowner who is paying more than Rs 7,500 per month as house maintenance charges to the Resident Welfare Association (RWA), housing society, will need to pay 18% GST also. But there is a way to avoid this, even if you are paying more than Rs 7,500 per month. This option is dependent on the respective RWA, housing soceity's annual turnover. Read below to know more. TIL Creatives Pay GST on society maintenance if monthly charge is more than this and annual collection is above Rs 20 lakh All homeowners who live in a housing society need to pay some money to the housing society/RWA for the maintenance and welfare of the building. But did you know that on this maintenance charges paid by the homeowner, GST at 18% rate also needs to be paid. Goods and Services Tax (GST) at 18% rate is required to be paid by all homeowners who are living in a housing society that has an annual turnover of more than Rs 20 lakh or Rs 10 lakh (in some states) and the monthly maintenance charges paid is more than Rs 7500. Income Tax Guide Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 Income Tax Calculator 2025 New Income Tax Bill 2025 Say for example a housing society/RWA collects Rs 10 lakh per year from its members but during the year due to an urgent building maintenance need, the housing society had to collect Rs 21 lakh. In this case the respective housing society/RWA needs to take GST registration. However, GST registration once taken means the respective housing society/RWA  have to keep complying with the applicable GST provisions year on year even if its turnover is below Rs 20 lakh, unless they cancel their GST registration. However, despite the society taking GST registration, if the monthly maintenance amount is Rs 7500 or less from each members, then there is no need to pay GST and it does not matter if the annual collection of the society is more than Rs 20 lakh. Read below to know more about GST on housing society maintenance and how it works if you have multiple units in a single society, and who can avoid paying GST. Who has to pay GST on society maintenance charges? Sanjay Chhabria, Indirect Tax Lead, Nexdigm, explains the primary criteria to determine whether GST is to be levied on housing society maintenance charges are: Live Events 1. Aggregate collection from members: The RWA or housing society's aggregate turnover should exceed Rs 20 lakh (Rs 10 lakhs for special category states), and 2. Monthly contribution taken from each member: The individual contribution per member per month exceeds Rs 7500. \"Both the above mentioned conditions must be satisfied together, for levying GST on maintenance expenses charged by RWA\u2019s to its member, Also note that the GST at 18% is applicable on the entire amount (not just the excess over Rs 7500),\" says Chhabria. \u201cResident Welfare Association (RWA) shall be required to pay GST on monthly subscription/ contribution charged from its members, only if such subscription is more than Rs 7500 per month per member and the annual aggregate turnover of RWA by way of supplying of services and goods is also Rs. 20 lakhs or more,\u201d said the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBDT) said in a circular dated July 22, 2019 According to Anand Parasrampuria, Associate Partner, Dhruva Advisors LLP, \u201cIn case, the annual turnover of the Housing Society exceeds Rs 20 lakh, then it is mandatory for the society to obtain GST registration. Furthermore, the Housing Society is liable to pay GST on monthly maintenance charges, if the maintenance charge exceeds Rs 7500 per month per member. Which individuals are exempt from paying GST on house society maintenance charges? If the homeowner is paying a monthly maintenance amount of up to Rs 7500 then GST is not required to be paid. The CBIC said in the circular, \u201cIf aggregate turnover of an RWA does not exceed Rs 20 Lakh in a financial year, it shall not be required to take registration and pay GST even if the amount of maintenance charges exceeds Rs 7500 per month per member\u201d \"If your individual contribution per member per month is Rs 7500 or less, no GST is charged even if the society is registered,\" says Chhabria. Table showing how is exempt from paying GST: Annual turnover of housing society/RWA Monthly maintenance charge Whether exempt from GST? More than Rs 20 lakh More than Rs 7,500 Not exempt from GST. More than Rs 20 lakh Rs 7,500 or less Yes, exempt from GST. Rs 20 lakh or less More than Rs 7,500 Yes, exempt from GST. Rs 20 lakh or less Rs 7,500 or less Yes, exempt from GST. Source: CBIC circular. How does GST on house maintenance charges work for those with multiple apartments in same housing society or RWA? \"If a person owns multiple residential apartments in a housing society or residential complex, they will be required to pay Rs 7,500 monthly individually to each apartment they own,\" says  Manmeet Kaur, Partner at Karanjawala & Co. Chartered Accountant Siddharth Surana explains: \"Each flat or apartment in the residential society would be treated separately and the exemption of Rs 7,500 per month shall be applied per flat/residential apartment regardless of being owned by a same individual.\" \"Thus, if the amount collected by the society from each flat is Rs. 7,000 and if Mr. A owns two flats in a society making him liable for a total maintenance shell-out of Rs. 14,000 per month, it would not attract GST since maintenance charged for each individual flat is Rs. 7,000 per month which qualifies for the exemption as per the CGST(Rate) Notification No. 12/2017 and as amended from time to time,\" he says. How is the Rs 20 lakh threshold calculated for housing society\u2019s GST registration purposes? Parasrampuria from Dhruva Advisors LLP explains how this turnover threshold of Rs 20 lakh is calculated. He says: \u201cA housing society is obligated to obtain GST registration, if its aggregate annual turnover, in a financial year exceeds Rs 20 lakh. This threshold applies to total amounts collected from members, whether or not GST is actually payable on those amounts.\u201d Chhabria from Nexdigm explains: \"If a society\u2019s income crosses the threshold of Rs 20 lakh at any point in time during a financial year, it would be liable to obtain GST registration. Further, once this registration is obtained the society would have to keep complying with the applicable GST provisions year on year. In a case, where the total turnover drops below 20 lakh and the contribution from the members continues to be above Rs 7500, in this case GST will be applicable till the registration is cancelled. Accordingly, in this case, the RWA would have to contemplate if they want to continue with the GST registration or apply for cancellation.\" \"Further, the value on which GST would be applicable on includes all maintenance charges, sinking fund, corpus fund, or contributions collected in any name, by the society. However, it would not include recoveries towards property tax or any other tax wherein the society is acting as mere agent for collecting and discharging on behalf of the flat owners. Please note, one-time collections for (e.g. repainting, capital repair) are also included for calculating the limit of Rs 7,500,\" says Chhabria. Siddharth Chandrashekhar, Advocate & Panel Counsel for CBIC & CBDT, says this threshold limit includes all taxable, exempt, and non-taxable supplies. \u201cThis annual limit is not a one-time cap or linked to sporadic charges for one-off services like a flat repaint; it strictly applies to cumulative income over the financial year. Essentially, it functions as a safeguard, ensuring small associations remain compliant without the full regulatory burden of GST registration while larger turnover entities must collect and remit GST as per the full applicable amount,\" he says. GST registration for a housing society is mandatory if its turnover is more than the GST eligibility criteria. \"It is mandatory for the society to register under GST as per Section 22 of the CGST Act if it is collecting more than Rs 20 lakhs annually as maintenance. Failure to register despite being liable constitutes non-compliance and can lead to penalties, interest, and even a notice from the GST department,\" says Kaur. Chandrashekhar says: \"Once the aggregate annual receipts exceed Rs 20 lakh and the per-member maintenance exceeds Rs 7,500, the housing society must register for GST. Failing to do so exposes the society to compliance risks, including penalties, interest, & potential legal scrutiny by tax authorities. The authorities could view continued collection above the prescribed limits without registration as a deliberate lapse. Failure to comply can invite penalties: 100% tax due + interest (@18%) + fines. Even retroactive liability! The RWA\u2019s exemption shield disappears if and when turnover crosses \u20b920 lakh. Tax Authorities may pursue a combination of recovery, audits, or prosecution. Compliance here isn\u2019t just optional\u2014it\u2019s survival!.\" Frequently asked questions (FAQs) on GST levied on RWA monthly maintenance charges CBIC in the circular released some FAQs about how GST on house monthly maintenance charges: FAQ 1: Where a person owns two or more flats in the housing society or residential complex, whether the ceiling of Rs. 7500/- per month per member on the maintenance for the exemption to be available shall be applied per residential apartment or per person? Answer: As per general business sense, a person who owns two or more residential apartments in a housing society or a residential complex shall normally be a member of the RWA for each residential apartment owned by him separately. The ceiling of Rs 7500 per month per member shall be applied separately for each residential apartment owned by him. For example, if a person owns two residential apartments in a residential complex and pays Rs 15000 per month as maintenance charges towards maintenance of each apartment to the RWA (Rs 7500 per month in respect of each residential apartment), the exemption from GST shall be available to each apartment. FAQ 2: How should the RWA calculate GST payable where the maintenance charges exceed Rs 7500 per month per member? Is the GST payable only on the amount exceeding Rs 7500 or on the entire amount of maintenance charges? Answer: The exemption from GST on maintenance charges charged by a RWA from residents is available only if such charges do not exceed Rs 7500 per month per member. In case the charges exceed Rs 7500 per month per member, the entire amount is taxable. For example, if the maintenance charges are Rs 9000 per month per member, GST @18% shall be payable on the entire amount of Rs 9000 and not on [Rs. 9000 - Rs. 7500] = Rs 1500. FAQ 3: Is the RWA entitled to take input tax credit of GST paid on input and services used by it for making supplies to its members and use such ITC for discharge of GST liability on such supplies where the amount charged for such supplies is more than Rs 7,500 per month per member? Answer: RWAs are entitled to take ITC of GST paid by them on capital goods (generators, water pumps, lawn furniture etc.), goods (taps, pipes, other sanitary/hardware fillings etc.) and input services such as repair and maintenance services.

While acknowledging Iran isn't there yet, Grossi stated they have the necessary components. His statement came just before his scheduled visit to Tehran for talks with senior officials. Reuters FILE PHOTO: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi and the deputy chief of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, Behrouz Kamalvandi, pose for a photo at the Natanz nuclear site in Isfahan, Iran, November 15, 2024. Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran/WANA (West Asia News Agency)/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Iran is not far from having an atomic bomb, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog was quoted as saying in a Le Monde interview published Wednesday, just hours before a visit to Tehran. International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said Iran still had a way to go before getting the bomb, but added: \"They're not far from it, you have to acknowledge.\" Grossi likened the development of a nuclear weapon to a jigsaw puzzle, adding that Iran \"has the pieces and they could eventually put them together one day\". Grossi was due in Iran later Wednesday for talks with senior officials. The UN watchdog was tasked with overseeing Iran's compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal that fell apart after Donald Trump withdrew from it during his first term as US president.

A highlight was the launch of the Sustainable Hospitality Handbook, created by HAI and MakeMyTrip, offering hotels practical guidance for eco-friendly practices. Deep Kalra, chair, World Travel & Tourism Council, India Chapter and managing trustee, MakeMyTrip Foundation The first edition of the India Travel & Tourism Sustainability Conclave, organised by MakeMyTrip Foundation and World Travel & Tourism Council India Initiative (WTTCII), was held in New Delhi on Wednesday. The event saw the launch of the Sustainable Hospitality Handbook , developed by the Hotel Association of India (HAI) in collaboration with MakeMyTrip. MakeMyTrip said the handbook offers hotels a 'practical framework' to adopt 'environmentally responsible' practices across energy, water, waste, and community impact. MakeMyTrip said it draws on globally recognized methodologies and Indian case studies, aiming to make sustainability implementation accessible across the hospitality spectrum. The company said as a direct next step from the day\u2019s discussions, the MakeMyTrip Foundation and WTTCII will work towards developing a report on sustainable travel & tourism in India. The document will draw on the insights and priorities surfaced at the conclave to outline a roadmap for action. \"We need more such platforms that bring the tourism ecosystem together for a meaningful dialogue on sustainability. I am happy to see the MakeMyTrip Foundation and WTTCII take the lead in facilitating these conversations, and hope to see outcomes from today inform how the sector grows in the years ahead,\" said tourism and culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. Deep Kalra, chair, World Travel & Tourism Council, India Chapter and managing trustee, MakeMyTrip Foundation, said sustainability cannot remain a peripheral concern when it comes to the future of India's travel and tourism sector. Live Events \"It must be embedded at the very core of how we envision growth of businesses. This will require greater alignment between policy, industry, and implementation at the grassroot level. Through this Conclave, our endeavour was to move beyond conversation and focus on action. The Sustainable Hospitality Handbook is a step in that direction, and the proposed report will help carry the momentum forward,\" he added. It was encouraging to see the conclave bring together strong voices to focus not just on why sustainability matters, but how companies can act on it, said K.B. Kachru, president, Hotel Association of India. \"The Sustainable Hospitality Handbook is intended to support that effort by offering practical and adaptable guidance. It is designed to support hotels of all sizes in embracing more conscious practices, and we hope it inspires wider adoption across the sector,\" he added. Discussions at the conclave covered a range of subjects\u2014from decarbonising aviation and electrifying public transport to reducing resource use in hotels and building more resilient local economies. Leaders from companies such as Air India Express, SpiceJet , Akasa Air, ITC , IHCL, Lemon Tree, Sarovar Hotels, GreenCell, Chalo, Momentum India, IIM Lucknow, and TERI participated in the discussions.

The company's shares plummeted after the order, which revealed that funds raised for electric vehicles were misused, including luxury real estate purchases. SEBI highlighted corporate governance failures and cautioned investors due to the stock's volatility and potential risks. THE ECONOMIC TIMES Gensol Engineering share price: Sebi has barred Gensol\u2019s promoters, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, from accessing the securities market. Gensol Engineering shares opened at their 5% lower circuit at Rs 122.68 on the NSE in early trade on Wednesday, after the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) barred its promoters \u2014 Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi \u2014 from accessing the securities market, citing financial mismanagement and diversion of funds. The order follows a detailed probe that began after complaints of share price manipulation and default in loan repayments. In a strongly worded order Sebi said, there is complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol as a listed company. \"The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm.\" Sebi said Gensol had raised Rs 975 crore in loans from institutions like IREDA and PFC for buying electric vehicles. However, only a part of the money was actually used for that purpose. The probe by the regulator showed that more than Rs 200 crore was routed through a car dealer and cycled back to promoter-linked entities. Some of it was used for unrelated personal expenses, including buying luxury real estate.

The diversions would mean they need to be written off from the company\u2019s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors,\" Sebi said. In addition, Sebi has also found that Gensol submitted forged documents to credit rating agencies to falsely claim timely debt repayments. The diversion of funds of the company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, according to the regulator, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. \"The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities,\" the regulator said. Sebi took note of the recent stock split of 1:10 announced by the company and acknowledged that this might attract more retail investors to the scrip. Hence, it issued an interim order to protect the interests of the investors and preserve market integrity. The regulator also cautioned investors to be careful while investing their savings in the capital markets.

ETMarkets.com Vedanta shares: Vedanta's oil and gas subsidiary, Cairn Oil & Gas, has secured seven new exploration blocks under OALP Round IX. Shares of Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta are expected to be in focus on Wednesday, April 16, following a key announcement that its oil and gas subsidiary, Cairn Oil & Gas, has acquired seven new exploration blocks under OALP Round IX , significantly expanding its portfolio in India\u2019s hydrocarbon sector . In a regulatory filing submitted on April 15, Vedanta disclosed that Cairn Oil & Gas has emerged as the largest private player to win blocks in the ninth round of the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) auction. \u201cCairn Oil & Gas, part of Vedanta Group and India\u2019s largest private oil and gas producer, has acquired 7 new blocks in the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) Round IX auction. The contract signing ceremony of the newly acquired exploration blocks was officiated here today in the presence of Shri Hardeep Singh Puri, Hon\u2019ble Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas,\u201d the company said in its exchange filing. With this acquisition, Cairn\u2019s total tally of OALP blocks has risen to 69, covering an extensive area of approximately 73,000 square kilometers across the country. The new blocks, comprising four onshore and three shallow water blocks, are located in the oil-rich regions of Cambay, Saurashtra, and Mumbai. Notably, Cairn holds 100% participatory interest in all of its OALP blocks, strengthening its control over exploration and development efforts. Live Events The development is expected to enhance Cairn\u2019s domestic production capabilities, aligning with its long-term vision of contributing 50% of India\u2019s crude oil output. The announcement could draw investor interest as it marks a strategic step in Vedanta\u2019s energy portfolio expansion and underlines its ambition to play a larger role in India\u2019s energy security. \u201cI congratulate Minister Hardeep Singh Puri for a successful auction. Today, India\u2019s policies for the hydrocarbons sector are the most attractive in the world. They offer tremendous opportunity and returns on capital,\u201d said Anil Agarwal, Chairman of Vedanta Group, while commenting on the occasion. On Tuesday, Vedanta shares closed 4.4% higher at Rs 396.85 on the NSE.

This move aligns with regulatory requirements for captive power consumption. ETMarkets.com UltraTech Cement on Wednesday announced its decision to acquire 26 per cent stake in renewable energy company, AMPIN C&I Power Eight, for Rs 25.5 crore. \"The company has entered into Energy Supply Agreement and Share Subscription and Shareholders Agreement and to acquire 26% equity shares of AMPIN C&I Power Eight Private Limited, a company engaged in generation and transmission of renewable energy. The acquisition is for the purposes of meeting the Company\u2019s green energy needs, optimising energy cost and comply with regulatory requirements for captive power consumption under electricity laws,\" said UltraTech in a stock exchange filing. Previously, UltraTech said that it will acquire Wonder WallCare, a manufacturer of wall putty, for an enterprise value not exceeding Rs 235 crore as part of its aggressive expansion strategy. This acquisition will enhance the portfolio of value-added products for the country\u2019s largest producer of cement. The Aditya Birla group firm is expanding its capacity through acquisitions and brownfield as well as greenfield expansions. It plans to add 26.5 MTPA in FY26 and FY27. In the cement business, the firm is expanding its capacity through acquisitions and capacity enhancement as it faces competition from billionaire Gautam Adani-led Adani Group's Ambuja Cement, which is the second largest player and is also scaling its capacity. Live Events The company also operates 4,432 UltraTech Building Solutions outlets across the country, which provide a 'one-stop building solution for the retail customer'.

Read Today's Paper WTO slashes 2025 trade growth forecast, warns of deeper slump SECTIONS WTO slashes 2025 trade growth forecast, warns of deeper slump Reuters Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 07:42:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis The World Trade Organization has significantly lowered its global merchandise trade forecast, now anticipating a 0.2% decline this year due to increased U.S. tariffs and related repercussions. This downturn, potentially the worst since the COVID-19 pandemic, raises concerns about broader economic consequences, especially for developing nations. The WTO also fears a decoupling of the U.S. Reuters WTO The World Trade Organization sharply cut its forecast for global merchandise trade from solid growth to a decline on Wednesday, saying further U.S. tariffs and spillover effects could lead to the heaviest slump since the height of the COVID pandemic. The WTO said it expected trade in goods to fall by 0.2% this year, down from its expectation in October of 3.0% expansion. It said its new estimate was based on measures in place at the start of this week. \"I'm very concerned, the contraction in global merchandise trade growth is of big concern,\" WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told reporters in Geneva. U.S. President Donald Trump imposed extra duties on steel and car imports as well as more sweeping global tariffs before unexpectedly pausing higher duties on a dozen economies. His trade war with China has also intensified with tit-for-tat exchanges pushing levies on each other's imports beyond 100%. The WTO said that, if Trump reintroduced the full rates of his broader tariffs that would reduce goods trade growth by 0.6 percentage points, with another 0.8 point cut due to spillover effects beyond U.S.-linked trade. Live Events Taken together, this would lead to a 1.5% decline, the steepest drop since 2020. \"If we have contraction in global merchandise the concern is spill over into broad GDP growth. We've seen that the trade concerns can have negative spill overs into financial markets, into other broader areas of the economy,\" Okonjo-Iweala added. She also raised alarm about the impact on developing countries. DECOUPLING FEAR The head of the WTO said her greatest fear was that the economies of China and the U.S. were decoupling from one another. The WTO estimates that merchandise trade between them will fall by 81% - a drop that could have reached 91% without recent exemptions for products such as smartphones. \"A decoupling could have far reaching consequences if it were to contribute to a broader fragmentation of the global economy along geopolitical lines to two isolated blocks,\" Okonjo-Iweala said. In this scenario, global GDP could shrink by 7% in the long term, which the director general described as \"significant and substantial\". \"The unprecedented nature of the recent trade policy shifts means that predictions should be interpreted with more caution than usual,\" said the WTO, which is also forecasting a modest recovery of 2.5% in 2026. Earlier on Wednesday, the U.N. Trade and Development agency said global economic growth could slow to 2.3% as trade tensions and uncertainty drive a recessionary trend. The Geneva-based WTO said disruption of U.S.-China trade was expected to increase Chinese merchandise exports across all regions outside North America by between 4% and 9%. Other countries would have opportunities to fill the gap in the United States in sectors such as textiles, clothing and electrical equipment. Services trade, though not subject to tariffs, would also take a hit, the WTO said, by weakening demand related to goods trade such as transport and logistics. Broader uncertainty could dampen spending on travel and investment-related services. The WTO said it expected commercial services trade to grow by 4.0% in 2025 and 4.1% in 2026, well below baseline projections of 5.1% and 4.8%. The expected downturn follows a strong 2024, when the volume of world merchandise trade grew by 2.9% and commercial services trade expanded by 6.8%.

Read Today's Paper India's passenger vehicle sales hit record high at 43 lakh units in FY25, utility vehicles driver of growth: SIAM SECTIONS India's passenger vehicle sales hit record high at 43 lakh units in FY25, utility vehicles driver of growth: SIAM ANI Last Updated: Apr 15, 2025, 11:52:00 AM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis India's passenger vehicle sales hit a record 4.3 million units in FY 2024-25, a 2% increase driven by Utility Vehicles. Exports surged by 14.6% to 0.77 million units, fueled by global demand. Overall, the auto industry grew 7.3% domestically and 19.2% in exports, with two-wheeler sales recovering strongly and electric vehicles gaining traction. SIAM anticipates continued growth in FY 2025-26. ANI Representative image. Passenger vehicle sales in India reached an all-time high of 4.3 million units in the financial year 2024-25, according to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). This marks a 2 per cent increase compared to the previous year, Utility Vehicles (UVs) remained the key growth driver in the passenger vehicle segment. Their share in overall sales rose to 65 per cent in FY 2024-25, up from around 60 per cent in the previous year. SIAM said, \"Passenger Vehicles (PV) posted its highest ever sales in FY 2024-25 of 4.3 million units, with a growth of 2 per cent as compared to FY 2023-24\". It also added that new model launches with modern designs and advanced features attracted more buyers. Additionally, attractive discounts and promotional offers helped keep up the demand. As per data, passenger vehicles also saw their highest-ever exports during the year, reaching 0.77 million units. Live Events This is a 14.6 per cent increase compared to FY 2023-24. The rise in exports was supported by demand for global models made in India, especially in Latin American and African markets. Some automakers even began exporting to developed countries. Overall, the Indian automobile industry grew 7.3 per cent in domestic sales and saw a strong 19.2 per cent jump in exports. SIAM credited this performance to strong customer demand, government support, infrastructure investments, and the growing focus on sustainable mobility. Positive economic policies and healthy market sentiment also helped sustain the growth. Two-wheeler sales saw solid recovery, with 19.6 million units sold in FY 2024-25, showing a growth of 9.1 per cent. Improved rural demand and rising consumer confidence played a key role in this growth. The scooter segment led the way, thanks to better connectivity in rural and semi-urban areas and the launch of new models with better features. Electric vehicles (EVs) also gained ground, with their share in total two-wheeler sales crossing 6 per cent during the year. Two-wheeler exports grew strongly by 21.4 per cent to reach 4.2 million units. This was due to new product launches and increased demand in Africa and Latin America. Looking ahead, SIAM expects the auto sector to continue its growth in FY 2025-26. Stable economic conditions, proactive government policies, and infrastructure spending are likely to support this growth. A normal monsoon, as forecasted, is also expected to boost demand, especially in rural and semi-urban areas.

This initiative, alongside a plan for annual passes priced around Rs 3,000 for unlimited travel, is likely to ease the burden on travelers to a significant degree. Road toll (Image for representation) The Ministry of Road Transport has given its approval for a toll exemption on National Highways (NHs) that has fewer than four lanes and has forwarded this proposal to the finance ministry for final approval, ToI reported on April 16. This initiative is part of two proposals currently under the finance ministry's consideration aimed at providing relief to millions of travelers using NHs and expressways. The second proposal involves the introduction of annual passes priced at approximately Rs 3,000, which would allow car owners unlimited travel, ToI's report (by Dipak K Dash) said. A high-ranking official within the road transport ministry indicated that these proposals have been sanctioned and sent to the finance ministry's expenditure department, as they may lead to some loss in revenue. While implementing annual passes could result in a decrease in toll income, eliminating toll collection on narrower highways is expected to have no financial impact, they noted. Previously, former road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had discussed the idea of offering both annual and lifetime passes for private vehicles; however, the ministry decided to focus solely on the annual pass due to its higher likelihood of acceptance among vehicle owners. The minister has been vocal about providing significant relief to highway users soon and has assured that this initiative would eliminate their complaints. According to sources, the proposal to eliminate tolls on two-and-a-half lane or two-lane NHs with paved shoulders was suggested by the minister during a review meeting, where he instructed officials to explore this option. The toll fees for these roads are approximately 60% lower than the charges for four-lane highways and above. Live Events Reports indicate there are around 200 toll plazas on these road segments, with almost all being publicly funded, meaning the tolls are collected by government agencies. In many instances, the toll revenue generated does not surpass the costs incurred in maintaining these roads. Therefore, eliminating tolls on these stretches could be a reasonable solution. The main concern lies with highways that have four lanes or more, as well as expressways, where a considerable number of private entities are involved in toll collection, and the government needs to address potential revenue losses incurred due to annual passes, according to a knowledgeable source. Data indicates that out of a total toll revenue of Rs 61,000 crore projected for 2024-25, private cars contribute approximately 20-21%, while a substantial 79-80% of the toll revenue is derived from commercial and heavy vehicles.

Agencies Electric passenger vehicle registrations crossed 1 lakh units last fiscal, registering a growth of 18 per cent compared to the previous year New Delhi: Electric vehicle registrations in the country increased 17 per cent to 19.7 lakh units last fiscal driven by various government policy interventions and new model launches, industry body SIAM said on Tuesday.

Read Today's Paper Bharti Hexacom pauses tower sale, plans new valuation amid TCIL objections SECTIONS Bharti Hexacom pauses tower sale, plans new valuation amid TCIL objections By Kalyan Parbat & Muntazir Abbas , ET Bureau Last Updated: Apr 15, 2025, 09:51:00 AM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Bharti Hexacom will re-evaluate its 3,400 telecom towers before seeking new bids from tower companies, following objections from shareholder TCIL regarding the initial valuation. The sale to Indus Towers was halted due to valuation differences and TCIL's demand for a transparent process. Bharti Airtel maintains confidence in the original proposal's merits despite the need for a fresh approach. Agencies Bharti Hexacom is likely to initiate a fresh valuation of its 3,400 telecom towers before inviting new bids from tower asset companies for their sale, said people with direct knowledge of the matter. The Bharti Airtel unit is likely to seek the bids through an open and transparent process in line with Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (Dipam) guidelines and Sebi rules, the people said. Bharti Hexacom was recently forced to halt plans to sell the wireless communication towers to Indus Towers after objections from key shareholder, state-run Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd (TCIL). TCIL sought a fresh process that met its requirements as a government stakeholder. The tower asset sale, it is learnt, was also deferred following differences between Bharti and TCIL over the Rs 33-lakh-per-tower valuation of Bharti Hexacom\u2019s tower assets pegged by global professional services firm, Grant Thornton. \u201cIn line with transparency and robust corporate governance, we have agreed to put the current (Bharti Hexacom) proposal in abeyance and initiate a fresh process as required by our significant minority shareholder TCIL,\u201d a Bharti Airtel spokesperson said, responding to ET\u2019s queries. Live Events The Airtel spokesman, though, added that the company \u201cremains convinced about the business logic and merits of the earlier (Bharti Hexacom) proposal\u201d which got endorsement and strong support from shareholders and proxy agencies. TCIL, Indus and Grant Thornton did not respond to queries. Airtel has a 70% stake in Bharti Hexacom, with the Centre, through TCIL, holding 15%. Bharti Hexacom offers mobile services in Rajasthan and the Northeast. Under the original Indus Towers-Bharti sale deal announced in February, Indus was to buy a total 16,100 telecom towers from Airtel and Bharti Hexacom in a Rs 3,308.7 crore cash deal. Airtel was to sell 12,700 towers with Bharti Hexacom selling 3,400 towers. Indus acquired Airtel\u2019s towers but the deal with Bharti Hexacom was put on hold. Bharti Hexacom\u2019s 3,400 premium towers are valued at nearly twice that of Airtel\u2019s towers\u2014Rs 17 lakh per tower\u2014as they reach greater heights of 40 metres and above, offering wider coverage in the Northeast and Rajasthan circles. A person familiar with the matter said, \u201cit remains to be seen if Indus can be given a right of first refusal (RoFR) once the fresh bidding happens, given that both Bharti Hexacom and Indus are now Airtel subsidiaries\u201d.

Goyal said in a post on X that a delegation from Starlink, comprising of Vice President Chad Gibbs and senior director Ryan Goodnight met him. \u201cDiscussions covered Starlink\u2019s cutting-edge technology platform, their existing partnerships & future investment plans in India,\u201d Goyal said in the X post. Officials said as of now, no meeting with Communications Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia is planned. Live Events Starlink is yet to get the regulatory approvals in the country to start services, but the company has already announced partnerships with Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio. As per the deals, the Indian two telcos would sell its equipment and services at their outlets, besides exploring other means of cooperation. Starlink has agreed to a majority of the conditions to secure a license from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) but a few concerns remain. ET had earlier reported about Starlink\u2019s plan to offer massive satellite connectivity \u2014 a few terabytes per second of data throughput \u2014 in India, with a large amount of it already in place and can be provided immediately to customers once all the necessary approvals are obtained. Starlink is currently offering satcom services in many countries through its generation-1 satellites, totalling around 4,400 and generation-2 satellites, of which more than 2,500 have been already launched. Starlink plans to have 30,000 generation-2 satellites in coming years, the US major has told the government. The capacity over India will be unlocked once the approvals come.

Read Today's Paper PwC exits more than a dozen countries to avoid scandals SECTIONS PwC exits more than a dozen countries to avoid scandals Reuters Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 10:26:00 AM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis PwC is scaling back its global operations, shutting down businesses in several smaller and riskier countries following scandals and disagreements with local partners. The firm faced client losses and layoffs after being pressured to drop risky clients. This decision follows a fine in China for audit failures related to Evergrande's fraud and another in Britain related to Wyelands Bank. Agencies PwC (File Photo) PwC has shut down operations in more than a dozen countries that are deemed too small, risky or unprofitable, as the Big Four accounting firm aims to prevent repeats of scandals that have affected it, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. The decision was taken due to mounting differences with local partners, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter. Local leaders at the firm said they lost over a third of their business in recent years after pressure from PwC's global executives to drop risky clients, according to the report. PwC has faced an exodus of clientele and layoffs since last year. PwC declined to comment on the report to FT. PwC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside business hours. Live Events The accounting giant has cut ties with its Sub-Saharan Francophone Africa firms after a strategic review, the company said last month. China hit PwC's mainland China unit with a six-month suspension and a $62 million fine for audit failures related to property developer China Evergrande 's $78 billion fraud. Last month, Britain's Financial Reporting Council fined PwC 4.5 million pounds ($5.96 million) in relation to the audit of Wyelands Bank for its 2019 financial year. The firm is working with Saudi Arabia and its sovereign wealth fund to mend relations after the kingdom suspended activities between the $925 billion fund's holding company and PwC.

Read Today's Paper In major development in pharma, halt order enforced on production and sale of 35 fixed-dose combination drugs SECTIONS In major development in pharma, halt order enforced on production and sale of 35 fixed-dose combination drugs ET Online Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 01:22:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis India's drug regulator, CDSCO, has ordered a halt to the production, sale, and distribution of 35 fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs due to safety concerns. These drugs, including pain relievers and diabetes medications, lacked proper evaluation before approval. The CDSCO has directed state and Union territory regulators to reassess approval procedures, ensuring adherence to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. Agencies Halt order on production and sale of 35 combination drugs (Image for representation) The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation ( CDSCO ), the apex regulatory authority for pharmaceuticals in India, has mandated that drug regulators across all states and Union territories halt the production, sale and distribution of 35 fixed-dose combination ( FDC ) drugs, news agency PTI reported on April 16. These include various pain relievers, nutritional supplements, and medications for diabetes. In addition, the regulators have been instructed to reassess their approval procedures for such FDC drugs, ensuring that they adhere rigorously to the stipulations outlined in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 and its associated regulations. FDCs are classified as drugs that consist of two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) combined in a specific fixed ratio. The directive from CDSCO came after it became evident that some of these FDC drugs were authorized for manufacture, sale, and distribution without undergoing necessary evaluations of their safety and effectiveness, thereby presenting a significant threat to public health. In a communication dated April 11, Dr. Rajeev Raghuvanshi, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), referenced a letter from January 2013 which raised alarms about the issuance of manufacturing licenses for FDC drugs categorized as \"New Drugs\" without obtaining the requisite approvals from the DCGI. This issue has been consistently flagged, with various letters sent to the state licensing authorities that have granted permission for the production and sale of these unapproved FDCs. The latest such correspondence was dispatched in February of this year. The letter emphasised that it has come to the attention of the directorate that the licensing of certain FDC drugs occurred without the essential evaluation of their safety and efficacy, as mandated by the New Drug and Clinical Trial (NDCT) Rules of 2019 under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940. This lack of scrutiny poses a serious risk to public health, the letter highlighted. Live Events The approval of unapproved FDCs threatens patient safety and could result in adverse drug reactions, interactions, and other health hazards due to the absence of scientific validation. Following the issuance of show cause notices to the manufacturers, it was reported that these companies claimed their licenses were granted by the respective drug licensing authorities and that they had not contravened any regulations. This has led to inconsistent enforcement of the NDCT Rules 2019 across the nation, as pointed out in the letter. Given these circumstances, the letter urged all state and Union territory drug controllers to re-evaluate their approval processes for such FDCs and to ensure strict adherence to the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and its regulations. Furthermore, the communication provided a list of 35 unapproved FDCs that had previously been licensed by state or Union territory drug controllers for manufacture, sale, and distribution without the necessary safety and efficacy evaluations conducted by the CDSCO, which were subsequently canceled by Drug Licensing Authorities or voluntarily surrendered by manufacturers following the issuance of show cause notices.

Read Today's Paper Auto sales hit record highs for third year despite slowing growth, SIAM data shows SECTIONS Auto sales hit record highs for third year despite slowing growth, SIAM data shows By Sharmistha Mukherjee , ET Bureau Last Updated: Apr 15, 2025, 05:05:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Indian auto sales saw modest growth in fiscal year 2024-25, with passenger vehicle sales up 2% driven by utility vehicles. Two-wheeler sales surged by 9.1% due to rural demand, while three-wheelers also rose. Commercial vehicles experienced a slight decline. SIAM anticipates continued growth across segments in FY26, supported by stable policies, infrastructure spending, and a predicted normal monsoon. ANI Representative image. Car sales in the local market grew in low single-digits in the fiscal that ended on 31 March. Compared to last year, on a high base and amid slowing demand in the local market. As per data released by industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers ( SIAM ), as many as 4,301,848 cars, sedans and utility vehicles were sold last fiscal, which is an increase of 2% over 4,218,750 units sold the previous financial year. Promotional offers and discounts helped support demand last fiscal, when sales growth rate more than halved from 8.4% registered in FY24. In absolute volumes, though, automakers in India reported record sales in the segment for the third consecutive year. Passenger vehicle sales were driven by continued demand for utility vehicles, which comprised 65% of all cars sold in the country, up from 60% in FY24. Sales of scooters, motorcycles and mopeds in the year under review grew by 9.1% to 19,607,332 units due to improved rural demand and resurgence in consumer confidence. Growth in the segment was led by scooters which saw sales surge by 17.4% (vs 55 in motorcycles) on back of better connectivity in rural and semi-urban areas. Three-wheeler sales too went up by 6.7% to 741,420 units last fiscal driven by demand for last mile mobility solutions. Meanwhile, dispatches of commercial vehicles fell by 1.2% to 956,671 units. \u201cThough the overall trucks segment has witnessed a slight de-growth, but the requirement of freight movement has been suitably served with fleets migrating towards higher GVW vehicles. The expanding highways and expressway network is playing a crucial role in reducing logistics costs, enhancing regional connectivity which is auguring well with the performance of this segment\u201d, SIAM said. Infrastructure development helped in driving sales of buses for inter-city travels last fiscal. Focus on mass-mobility in intra-city routes also helped drive demand in this segment. Live Events \u201cThe Indian automobile industry continued its steady performance in FY2024\u201325, driven by healthy demand, infrastructure investments, supportive Government policies, and continued emphasis on sustainable mobility\u201d, Shailesh Chandra, President, SIAM said, adding, \u201cPassenger vehicles and three-wheelers witnessed a moderate growth on account of high base effect, but saw the highest ever sales in these categories, while the two-wheeler segment registered strong growth in FY2024-25.\u201d Though sales of commercial vehicle fell last fiscal, Chandra said there has been some improvement in demand in the segment the last few months. All segments of the industry are expected to continue with the growth momentum in FY 2025\u201326, on back of stable macroeconomic conditions, proactive government policies, and Infrastructure spending by the Government. Chandra informed, \u201cLooking ahead, the backdrop of stable policy environment, along with recent measures such as reforms in personal income tax and RBI\u2019s rate cuts, will help in supporting consumer confidence and demand across segments.\u201d A normal monsoon, as currently forecasted for 2025, is expected to support broader economic activity, especially in rural and semi-urban regions, which would be a tailwind for auto sector demand. The sector is also expected to benefit from the reforms in the personal income tax announced in the recent Union Budget of 2025-26, which has been followed by two back-to-back rate cuts by RBI. These measures would help in creating demand by increased accessibility of vehicle financing, SIAM said. Meanwhile, policy interventions of Government of India including Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS), the PM E DRIVE and PM e-Sewa schemes, coupled with EV launches by several manufacturers has provided the necessary momentum for the adoption of electric vehicles in the country, SIAM said. As per vehicle registration data collated by SIAM from the VAHAN portal of the Ministry of Road, Transport & Highways (MoRTH), total EV registrations in the country reached 1.97 million units \u2013 a growth of 16.9% over 1.68 million units in FY24. Electric car registrations crossed 1 lakh units in FY 2024-25 registering a growth of 18.2% as compared to previous year. Registration of electric two-wheelers grew by 21.2% to 11.5 lakh units in FY25. Last fiscal, exports recovered across segments, particularly in passenger vehicles and two-wheelers segment reflecting improved global demand and India's growing competitiveness in manufacturing vehicles. Export demand in key markets of interest, such as Africa and neighbouring countries, is likely to continue as \u2018Made in India\u2019 vehicles are gaining traction Overall, SIAM said the automobile Industry will closely monitor macroeconomic factors and global geopolitics, which will determine the key demand conditions, and supply chain dynamics going forward. Last month, sales of passenger vehicles rose by 3.6% to 381,358 units. Two-wheeler sales grew 11.4% to 1,656,939 units, those of three-wheelers by 10.5% to 62,813 units.

Read Today's Paper US stock market projections today April 16: Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P 500 futures drop as Nvidia plunges on $5.5B China export hit; AMD, Apple, Micron fall too as Powell speech, retail sales add caution SECTIONS US stock market projections today April 16: Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P 500 futures drop as Nvidia plunges on $5.5B China export hit; AMD, Apple, Micron fall too as Powell speech, retail sales add caution Global Desk Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 08:17:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis U.S. stock market futures on April 16, are experiencing declines, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures down 54 points, S&P 500 futures falling by 40 points, and Nasdaq futures dropping 270 points. The downturn is largely attributed to Nvidia's announcement of a $5.5 billion charge due to new U.S. export controls on its H20 AI chips to China. This development has also impacted other semiconductor stocks, including AMD and Micron Technology. Additionally, ASML reported weaker-than-expected orders, further weighing on the tech sector. Investors are closely watching Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech and the release of retail sales data for further market direction. US Stock Market News 16 April \u2013 Nvidia's $5.5B charge due to U.S. export restrictions impacts tech stocks; Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures decline US stock market is showing mixed signals on April 16, 2025, as futures continue to decline with caution prevailing ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s much-anticipated speech. Recent data indicates that technology concerns, particularly from Nvidia\u2019s export restrictions, are driving today's market moves. What are the key futures numbers today? Dow Jones Futures : Down 54 points S&P 500 Futures : Down 40 points Nasdaq Futures : Slid 270 points These figures come on the heels of a two-day rally that has now been reversed amid increased worries over export controls affecting tech giants. Also Read: Nvidia share price crashes today: Why have AI giant stocks fallen on Wednesday? How are key market indicators looking today? Here\u2019s a quick look at the major futures and indexes as of early Tuesday: E-Mini Dow (YM00): 40,553.00 USD, down 22.00 (-0.05%) E-Mini S&P 500 (ES00): 5,390.00 USD, down 38.25 (-0.70%) E-Mini Nasdaq 100 (NQ00): 18,705.25 USD, down 255.00 (-1.34%) Cboe Volatility Index (VIX): 31.53, up 4.68% U.S. 10-Year Yield: 4.318%, down 0.021 WSJ Dollar Index: 96.38, down 0.40% Gold prices surged past $3,300 per ounce, signaling investors are leaning into safe-haven assets ahead of possible turbulence. Meanwhile, crude oil prices dipped by about 1% in early Asia trade. Live Events Why is Nvidia impacting the market so heavily? Nvidia has warned of a $5.5 billion quarterly charge after the US government imposed new export restrictions on its H20 processors intended for China and other nations. As a result, Nvidia shares dropped over 6% in premarket trading. This announcement has not only rattled investors directly in Nvidia but has also contributed to declines among other semiconductor stocks such as AMD (down over 6%), Micron Technology (down 4%), and a notable earnings miss from ASML, whose shares fell more than 4%. How are broader trade tensions influencing investor sentiment? Recent Chinese GDP data exceeded expectations with a 5.4% year-over-year growth in the first quarter, largely driven by a surge in exports. However, trade talks with Washington have stalled\u2014China has even removed its top trade negotiator amid these tensions. The stalled negotiations, coupled with new export controls, have caused uncertainty, especially impacting tech shares across the Asia-Pacific region. What is happening with other major stocks and sectors? Abbott Laboratories : Announced it will invest $500 million to expand US manufacturing in Illinois and Texas, reinforcing its guidance with adjusted full-year earnings expected between $5.05 and $5.25 per share. Renault/Nissan Update : Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard is set to leave Nissan\u2019s board, part of a broader leadership shakeup aimed at stabilizing the struggling automaker. Sector Movements : While crude prices dipped by about 1% in Asian markets, gold has surged, crossing the $3,300 mark, as investors flock to safe-haven assets amid heightened volatility. How are global markets reacting to U.S.-China trade tensions? The imposition of new tariffs by the U.S. and retaliatory measures by China have heightened global trade tensions. This has led to widespread declines in international markets: Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC 40 have recorded losses. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index has dropped by 1.9%. Japan's Nikkei index is down by 1%. What are the technical indicators suggesting? Technical analysis reveals that both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have formed a \"death cross,\" where the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average. This pattern is often interpreted as a bearish signal, indicating potential further declines. Which economic indicators should investors watch today? Investors are keeping a close eye on several critical data releases and events: Jerome Powell\u2019s speech : Expected to provide insights into future monetary policy amid current economic uncertainty. Retail Sales Data : March figures are awaited to gauge consumer spending and overall economic health. Global Indicators : Notably, European market openings and the WSJ Dollar Index readings, which currently stand at 96.38 (down 0.40%), play a crucial role in the global sentiment. What do technical signals indicate about the near-term market outlook? Analysts note that technical charts for both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 now display bearish signals. With the VIX (Cboe Volatility Index) recently jumping to 31.53 and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield cooling at 4.318%, there is a mix of defensive positioning and cautious trading. While some believe the market may correct further, others advise a careful watch on upcoming earnings reports and economic data before making long-term decisions. Investors and traders continue to monitor these developments closely. The interplay between tightening US export controls, mixed earnings reports, and shifting global economic indicators is creating an atmosphere of uncertainty. As the market prepares for Powell\u2019s speech and more earnings data is released, every move now is critically important.

What should I do if I can't file my taxes today? If you're not ready to file your full tax return today, you can still request an extension. Filing IRS Form 4868 gives you until October 15, 2025, to complete your return. Here\u2019s how you can request a tax extension today: Use IRS Free File to submit Form 4868 electronically (available until midnight). Make a payment on irs.gov and choose \"extension\" as the reason. That counts as filing. Use tax software like TurboTax or H&R Block. Mail a paper Form 4868\u2014but it must be postmarked April 15. Just remember: an extension to file is not an extension to pay. Your estimated taxes are still due today. who gets an automatic extension without filing form 4868?

That includes: Live Events U.S. citizens and resident aliens living and working outside the U.S.\u2014they get until June 15 to file.

Make sure to check if your state (like California\u2019s Franchise Tax Board or FTB) offers similar extensions. Do I still have to pay my taxes by April 15, 2025, if I filed an extension? Yes, the IRS still expects your payment today\u2014even if you file for an extension. If you can\u2019t pay the full amount, try to pay at least 90% of what you owe to avoid the steepest penalties. You can pay using: IRS Direct Pay Debit or credit card through the IRS-approved third-party sites The IRS2Go app Making any payment today helps reduce the late payment fees, which can add up fast. What are the penalties if I miss the tax deadline without doing anything? If you neither file your return nor request an extension by midnight on April 15, the IRS will start charging: A 5% late-filing penalty per month, up to 25% of the unpaid taxes. A 0.5% late-payment penalty, also monthly. Daily interest, currently around 7% annually. Let\u2019s say you owe $2,000. In just 5 months, your penalties could rise to $2,500 or more. Filing something today\u2014either a return or an extension\u2014makes a big difference. What if I can't afford to pay my taxes today? If you can't pay your taxes in full, the IRS has payment plans available. You can apply for: A short-term payment plan (up to 180 days) A long-term installment agreement if you need more time Set up a plan on the IRS Payment Portal. You\u2019ll still be charged interest, but entering a plan can help you avoid collections or tax liens. It\u2019s better to set something up today rather than ignore it and hope for the best.

Read Today's Paper Amid tariff brawl, oil prices may not fall to 2015-16 level: BPCL SECTIONS Amid tariff brawl, oil prices may not fall to 2015-16 level: BPCL By Sanjeev Choudhary , ET Bureau Last Updated: Apr 15, 2025, 09:49:00 AM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis BPCL's finance chief, Vetsa Ramakrishna Gupta, anticipates oil prices to remain stable in the near term, fluctuating between $60-70 per barrel as US tariff uncertainties resolve. He dismisses the possibility of a significant price crash similar to 2015-16, expecting OPEC to implement production cuts if prices decline to $50-55. iStock Oil prices are unlikely to fall dramatically to the levels seen in 2015\u201316, which benefited India immensely, as uncertainties around US tariffs are likely to clear in two-three months, and producers may resort to supply cuts to arrest a free fall in prices, said the finance chief of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited ( BPCL ). These are \u201cgood times\u201d for oil marketing companies, BPCL director-finance Vetsa Ramakrishna Gupta told ET in an interview, referring to the large cash generation and margin boost that lower crude prices bring. Despite US sanctions, Russian oil is \u201cstill more commercially viable\u201d than others, and BPCL is facing no issue in sourcing it or paying for it, he said. Oil prices are likely to stay in the $60-65 per barrel range for the next two\u2013three months and may inch higher to the $65-70 range after the tariff uncertainties fade, Gupta said. The baseline tariff issue between the US and major countries is likely to be resolved during this period, he said. Recent tariff declarations of more than 100% by the US and China on each other\u2019s goods are just \u201ctactical moves\u201d ahead of negotiations, Gupta said. \u201cWithout US, China cannot survive. Without China, the US cannot survive,\u201d he said, adding that the two countries will have to strike a deal. The current uncertainties are \u201csufficient\u201d to disturb demand, which is weighing on oil prices, Gupta said. He, however, ruled out a repeat of the price crash witnessed in the past decade when crude prices plunged to below $30 in early 2016 from above $100 per barrel in the middle of 2014, benefitting Indian refiners, consumers and the government handsomely. Benchmark Brent averaged $44 in 2016, down from $52 per barrel in 2015. Live Events \u201cI don\u2019t think the price will fall down drastically. If prices fall to $50-55 level, automatically production cuts will happen,\u201d Gupta said, adding that producer cartel OPEC will be the first to cut supplies. Even US producers will delay new investments, he said, adding, \u201cMost of the new US shale drilling cost is in the $45-50 per barrel range. They will take a pause. They will not go for cash loss. They will need $65-70.\u201d The top priority for BPCL is to ensure its customers are well supplied at all times, Gupta said. \u201cMy market supply should not be disrupted. Price will go up, come down,\u201d he said. The recent fall in crude prices will show up in the inventory losses for oil marketing companies in the first quarter, he said. Lower crude prices result in lower fuel costs and losses for refineries. This boosts margins initially but slowly gets factored into product prices. BPCL operates three refineries with a combined nameplate capacity of 35 million tonnes a year and 23,000 filling stations across the country.

REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File Photo Founder and chief executive officer Vijay Shekhar Sharma has voluntarily forgone 2.1 crore share of Paytm parent One97 Communications , the company told exchanges on Wednesday. The shares were granted to him under the One 97 Employees Stock Option Scheme, 2019, the filing further read. Following the action, which comes in the backdrop of a Sebi notice from August 2024, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Paytm board termed the unvested stock options as cancelled, and returned them to the ESOP pool under 2019 scheme, the company said. Sharma letting go of the stock will result in an \"one-time, non-cash, acceleration of ESOP expense of Rs 492 crore\" in the quarter ended March 2025, and an equivalent lowering of ESOP expenses in future years, Paytm said. The company will share the illustrative ESOP cost schedule along with financial results for the quarter and year ended March, date for which it is yet to declare. Vijay Shekhar Sharma, who is a public shareholder in the digital payments platform he founded, held over 5.78 crore shares as of March 2025, according to shareholding pattern data on BSE. At Wednesday's closing price of Rs 864.50, this amounts to a total value north of Rs 5,000.7 crore. In August last, SEBI had issued a notice stating that the issue of 2.1 crore ESOPs to Sharma violated the rules around share-based employee benefits. Large shareholders who can influence company decisions cannot hold ESOPs.

Read Today's Paper Heritage Foods to hike dairy prices to counter costs SECTIONS Heritage Foods to hike dairy prices to counter costs Reuters Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 01:55:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Indian dairy firm Heritage Foods plans to raise prices of its products\u2014including milk, paneer, and other dairy items\u2014by 2%-4% this financial year to offset rising fuel and raw material costs. The move follows a broader trend among consumer goods companies like Nestle India and Godrej Consumer Products, who are grappling with higher input costs and weaker demand. Agencies Indian dairy firm Heritage Foods will increase the prices of its products this financial year to offset rising costs such as fuel and raw material expenses, its CEO told Reuters. Consumer goods majors, including Nestle India and Cinthol soapmaker Godrej Consumer Products , are hiking prices to battle a double whammy of a slowdown in consumer spending and higher costs. \"The price increase will be across the board, not specifically on milk,\" Heritage CEO Srideep Kesavan said last week. \"It will also be on paneer and other dairy products ... in line with covering our costs increase.\" A one-litre pouch of Heritage toned milk is priced at 53 rupees (62 U.S. cents). The company intends to increase the price by 1 to 2 rupees, or 2%-4%, in the financial year that started on April 1. In comparison, the prices of milk and milk products in India rose 2.6%-2.9% in the January-March quarter, still below the broader inflation rate, according to government data. Live Events Heritage, which mainly caters to the Southern states, raised milk prices earlier this year, its first increase in nearly two years. It also plans to expand its footprint this year to 350,000 stores from 250,000 currently, including deeper growth in existing markets such as Chennai. Protein deficiency in India Dairy brands, from Amul to Milky Mist, have lately been highlighting the amount of protein on packages of everything from cottage cheese to curd as affluent Indians strive to meet daily protein requirements. Surveys indicate a majority of Indians have a protein-deficiency due to a largely vegetarian diet. But Heritage, according to Kesavan, will focus more on maintaining the taste of its products rather than reformulating its products to add more protein. \"Taste is more important than loud claims,\" he said.

From burlesque wear to Latin dances with swapped vowels, this puzzle (#675) had a clever mix of categories that kept players guessing. The Connections game challenges users to group 16 words into four related sets\u2014and today\u2019s clues were anything but ordinary. With hints like \u201cGypsy Rose Lee\u201d and \u201cEverybody dance now,\u201d the game was both fun and tricky. Agencies NYT Connections April 16 puzzle features Katy Perry in a clever \u201cThey Roar\u201d group. Discover today\u2019s tricky answers, smart strategies, and every hidden connection in game #675 NYT Connections puzzle for April 16, 2025 (Game #675) had one of the most surprising twists we've seen in a while\u2014Katy Perry showed up, and not in the way you'd expect. But that\u2019s what keeps this daily game so addictive. With clever wordplay, tricky themes, and a dash of pop culture, today's Connections was anything but predictable. Let\u2019s break down all the hints, categories, and answers that made this puzzle memorable. What are the clues given in today\u2019s NYT Connections puzzle? Like every day, the puzzle presented players with 16 words and the goal of grouping them into four sets of four that share a common theme. Today\u2019s clues, listed from easiest to hardest, were as follows: Yellow group hint: Think Gypsy Rose Lee. Green group hint: Abrade or scruff. Blue group hint: Tigers and jaguars do it. Purple group hint: Everybody dance now! These hints were subtle but smart. Some made you think visually, others leaned into sounds or actions, and the trickiest required spotting clever word transformations. What are the correct answers in today\u2019s Connections game? Today\u2019s Connections puzzle was filled with clever connections, and the purple group was particularly creative. Here\u2019s how it all played out: \ud83d\udfe8 Burlesque wear Boa Corset Garter Stockings Inspired by burlesque performances and vintage stage fashion, this set called back to performers like Gypsy Rose Lee. All four are iconic items associated with burlesque wear. Live Events \ud83d\udfe9 Mess up the surface of Scar Score Scrape Scratch These words all relate to damaging or marking a surface. Whether it's a wound or a surface defect, each word is about creating visible damage. \ud83d\udfe6 They roar Crowd Engine Katy Perry Lion This group mixed metaphor with literal meaning. Katy Perry earned her place thanks to her hit song \u201cRoar\u201d , tying her neatly to roaring engines, lions, and loud crowds. \ud83d\udfea Latin dances with a vowel changed Mamba (from Mambo ) Meringue (from Merengue ) Simba (a play on Samba ) Tangy (derived from Tango ) This group was the real brain teaser. Each word was a Latin dance, but with one vowel altered. If you didn\u2019t notice the vowel shifts, this one likely tripped you up. Why was Katy Perry included in the \u2018They roar\u2019 group? At first glance, seeing Katy Perry among words like \"engine\" and \"lion\" felt odd. But then you remember her mega-hit \u201cRoar\u201d , which makes her a perfect fit for the blue group. It\u2019s this kind of unexpected link\u2014between a pop star and an animal sound\u2014that makes Connections such a fun challenge. As CNET pointed out, today's themes played with both sound and word structure, keeping players on their toes. What was the trickiest part of the April 16 Connections puzzle? No doubt, the purple group gave many players a headache. The idea of transforming Latin dance names with a vowel swap isn\u2019t something most people think of immediately. Words like \u201cSimba\u201d (from Samba ) or \u201cTangy\u201d (from Tango ) aren\u2019t obvious at first glance. You had to pause, say the words out loud, and think beyond just dictionary meanings. This is a great example of how Connections puzzles push lateral thinking. How can you get better at solving NYT Connections puzzles? If you're looking to boost your win streak, here are a few smart strategies: Say the words out loud \u2013 Hearing the terms in context can help spark connections. Use the shuffle button \u2013 A quick shuffle often offers a fresh perspective. Look for pairs first \u2013 Matching just two words can sometimes help you build the full group. Avoid going with your first instinct \u2013 Connections often hides the true link beneath more obvious red herrings.

Global Desk Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 08:23:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Nvidia\u2019s shares fell 6.5 per cent in premarket trading. Rival chipmaker AMD's shares dropped 6.8 per cent. Reuters Nvidia stock price. Nvidia share price on Wednesday tanked, taking Nasdaq decisively lower after the AI giant disclosed a large financial hit from American export restrictions to China. Shares of Nvidia slumped nearly six per cent as the chip company disclosed that it expected a $5.5 billion hit this quarter due to a new US licensing requirement on the primary H20 chip it can legally sell in China. Nvidia, AMD Stocks Chipmaker Nvidia\u2019s shares fell 6.5 per cent in premarket trading after it said the U.S. had imposed stricter controls on its exports of one of its computer chips designed for use in artificial intelligence. Rival chipmaker AMD's shares dropped 6.8 per cent. Trade war concerns also were revived by a Trump administration announcement of an investigation into imports of critical minerals such as rare earths, which are used in smartphones, electric vehicles and many other products. Why Is Nvidia Stock Dropping Today? Nvidia sank after saying the U.S. government is restricting exports of its H20 chips to China, citing worries that they could be used to build a supercomputer. Live Events Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein analyst, said banning the H20 Chip 'makes no sense' as it would hand over the Chinese AI market to rivals Huawei. \"The impact of a full H20 wipeout is probably (about)30 cents or so at current levels (not enormous in the grand scheme of things),\" Rasgon said. U.S. officials have been aiming to prevent the sale of critical chip to China in an effort to maintain a competitive edge in the AI race. FAQs Q1. How are Nvidia\u2019s shares performing? A1. Chipmaker Nvidia\u2019s shares fell on Wednesday 6.5 per cent in premarket trading. Q2. What is USA government's stance on AI Chip? A2. U.S. officials have been aiming to prevent the sale of critical chip to China in an effort to maintain a competitive edge in the AI race.

Read Today's Paper AMNS India flags concerns over impact of US tariffs on domestic steel, aluminium industry SECTIONS AMNS India flags concerns over impact of US tariffs on domestic steel, aluminium industry PTI Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 04:35:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis AMNS India echoes SAIL's concerns over potential US tariffs, fearing increased steel imports into India. Ranjan Dhar emphasizes the domestic industry's need for protectionism, stating the Indian market lacks the capacity for additional imported steel, especially from China. While a 25% safeguard duty was anticipated, the DGTR recommended a 12% duty, awaiting the finance ministry's final decision. After SAIL , another large steel player AMNS India has raised concerns over the possible impact of the US administration's decision to impose tariffs on the domestic industry. \"The domestic steel industry needs protectionism\", Ranjan Dhar, Director & Vice President - Sales and Marketing at Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel (AMNS) India, told PTI, adding that and the Indian market does not have appetite for any imported steel. He made the remarks when asked about the impact of US President Donald Trump's announcement last month to impose 25 per cent tariffs on India's domestic steel and aluminium industry. Earlier, SAIL Chairman Amarendu Prakash had said the imposition of higher tariffs by the US may change the global \" trade flows \", increasing the chances of India becoming more vulnerable to steel imports as the countries exporting to the US may divert their shipments in the domestic market. Dhar said China -- the world's largest steel-producing country -- is among the steel-exporting nations to the US and if it does not find a market, it will have to divert its products somewhere. India's import got higher (in FY25) because China has produced over 1 billion tonne of steel. Their domestic consumption has not kept pace with the capacity that have increased. Last year they have exported 110 million tonne of steel. Live Events The official said the countries China was traditionally exporting to have developed their own steel capacity. India also has developed its own steel capacity. So, now, the market does not have appetite for any imported steel. Dhar also said the Indian steel industry was expecting a safeguard duty of 25 per cent. However, the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), the investigation arm of the commerce ministry, has recommended imposition of a 12 per cent provisional safeguard duty for 200 days on certain steel products with an aim to protect domestic players from surge in imports. The final decision to impose the duty will be taken by the finance ministry. Steel industry experts have said India's steel imports could reduce 50 per cent in FY26 while domestic manufacturers' profitability is expected to improve, if the government levies a safeguard duty on inbound shipments. President Trump on Wednesday (April 2, 2025) announced reciprocal tariffs on about 60 countries in a historic measure to counter higher duties imposed globally on American products. However, the tariffs have been put on hold until July 9. Recently, a Tata Steel official told PTI that the company is evaluating the situation and it would be premature to comment. A senior official of Naveen Jindal-owned Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) said the company is closely monitoring the impacts of the US announcements, and will share its comments at an appropriate time.

The system incorporates Ground Truth Perception, utilizing advanced lidar sensors and AI software from Wayve. Wayve's AI Driver software, trained with extensive real-world driving data, enables vehicles to navigate complex environments and make smarter decisions, promising long-term safety and performance improvements. Reuters Nissan Nissan on Wednesday announced that it will roll out its next-generation self-driving technology starting in FY27. This new system, called ProPILOT, will feature advanced safety and automation tools that aim to take autonomous driving to the next level. A key part of this new technology is Nissan's Ground Truth Perception system , which combines next-gen lidar sensors (used to see objects and surroundings) with artificial intelligence software from the UK-based company Wayve. The company says this setup will help vehicles better avoid collisions and make smarter decisions on the road \u2014 even in complex traffic situations . At the core of the new system is the integration of artificial intelligence developed by Wayve, a UK-based AI company specializing in embodied AI, a form of artificial intelligence trained through real-world driving experience rather than relying solely on pre-set rules or maps. As per Nissan, Wayve\u2019s AI Driver software is powered by a foundation model that can learn from massive volumes of driving data, allowing it to respond quickly to complex and unpredictable environments, such as urban traffic or changing road conditions. This adaptability, Nissan says, will give its future vehicles a long-term edge in safety and performance. Live Events \"Wayve AI Driver software, built on Wayve\u2019s embodied AI foundation model, is designed to handle highly complex real-world driving conditions in a human-like manner. The technology\u2019s ability to efficiently and rapidly learn from vast amounts of data ensures continuous advantage to Nissan vehicles for the future,\" the auto company said. Wayve, which is collaborating with multiple global automakers, says its software enables point-to-point autonomous driving across city and highway environments and is built to scale across different vehicle platforms.

The MPC, led by Governor Shaktikanta Das, will adhere to the 'withdrawal of accommodation' monetary policy stance. The repo rate is remains at 6.50% for the ninth consecutive time.

Further, the MPC, led by Das also sticks to the 'withdrawal of accommodation' stance of the monetary policy. \"MPC judged that it is important for monetary policy to stay the course while maintaining close vigil on risks,\" Das said while announcing the policy decision. The Committee, which consists of three RBI and three external members met from August 5-7 and in a 4:2 ratio arrived at a decision to hold the repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent for the ninth straight time.

He further noted that food inflation has weight of 46 per cent on headline inflation and that it cannot be 'ignored'. Cannot and should not become complacent because core inflation has fallen considerably, the governor further said. India's CPI in June stood at 5.1 per cent on the back of surge in vegetable prices. The CPI accelerated for the first time in five months, data showed in July. Key Highlights of August RBI MPC Meet MPC voted to keep repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue withdrawal of accommodation stance. Das said that the MPC has decided to focus on inflation and support price stability to ensure growth. The real GDP forecast for FY25 was kept unchanged at 7.2% with Q1 slightly reduced to 7.2 per cent; Q2 at 7.2 per cent; Q3 at 7.3 per cent; and Q4 at 7.2 per cent The real GDP for Q1FY26 is also projected at 7.2 per cent Das said that the moderation in Q1FY25 growth forecast is due to updated information on certain high frequency indicators. The RBI MPC projected inflation forecast for FY25 unchanged at 4.5 per cent, while it stands at 4.4 per cent for FY26. Inflation for Q2 has been hiked to 4.4 per cent from 3.8 per cent; Q3 projection raised to 4.7 per cent from 4.6 per cent and finally Q4 projection eased to 4.3 per cent from 4.5 per cent. MPC stays resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the 4 per cent target on a durable basis, RBI Guv said. India\u2019s current account deficit (CAD) moderated to 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2023-24 from 2.0 per cent of GDP in 2022-23 due to a lower trade deficit and robust servicesand remittances receipts. A degree of relief is expected due to healthy kharif sowing and picking up southwest monsoon, Das noted. The RBI Governor also laid emphasis on the need to 'carefully monitor' mobile tariffs and milk prices. The apex bank will continue to be nimble and flexible in liquidity management operations, Shaktikanta Das. RBI Guv Shaktikanta Das also expressed concern over rising disbursals of top-up home loans and has asked lenders to take remedial actions. India's forex reserves reached a new high of $675 billion as of August 2. The RBI expressed its concerns regarding the third-party outsourcing of technological requirements for banks and financial institutions in light of the global Microsoft outage that happened last month. The governor pressed for stakeholders in the fin sector to work towards eliminating any possibilities of cyber outages in the future. A focus on mobilizing household savings through innovative products is recommended Despite moderated credit growth in some sectors, personal loans are still growing rapidly, necessitating careful monitoring of leverage and reassessment of underwriting standards. RBI Guv noted that rapid growth in home equity and top-up loans, especially on collateralized loans, with some entities not adhering to regulatory guidelines, could lead to unproductive or speculative fund use. RBI has advised a review and necessary corrective actions. Key announcements The RBI has proposed to create a public repository of digital lending apps to help prevent unauthorised lenders. UPI tax payment limit has been hiked from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh per transaction. It has also been proposed to introduce continuous cheque clearing. Steps to speed up clearance of cheques to few hours will be taken up, Das said. RBI has decided to increase the frequency of credit information reporting by credit institutions (CIs) to credit information companies (CICs) from a monthly basis to a fortnightly basis or at such shorter intervals as agreed upon. RBI proposed to introduce \"Delegated Payments\" in UPI, which would allow an individual to set a UPI transaction limit for another individual (secondary user) on the primary user\u2019s bank account.

Electral sales have jumped 27% in March, leading the oral electrolyte market's growth. Doctors are reporting an increase in digestive disorder cases, further fueling the need for rehydration solutions as temperatures rise and waterborne diseases become more prevalent. Agencies Representational New Delhi: Amid the sweltering heat, demand for dehydration-preventing drinks has soared in India. According to market research firm PharmaTrac , sales of the widely used brand Electral have seen a sharp 27% rise in March, attributed to \"unusually high temperatures\" across the country. The sales of oral electrolytes have risen from \u20b985 crore in January to \u20b9106.5 crore in March this year, the data showed. The month-on-month growth for brand Electral was highest among other oral electrolytes. Sales zoomed to \u20b940 crore in March. The other popular rehydration solution, which is Johnson & Johnson's ORS-L, notched up sales of over \u20b99 crore in March, up from \u20b96 crore in January this year in the domestic pharma retail market. On a MAT (moving annual total) basis, the market for dehydration drinks grew to \u20b98.5 lakh crore. \"Heatwaves throughout the country have also led to growth of ORS,\" said Sheetal Sapale, VP, commercial, PharmaTrac said. Live Events While the oral electrolyte market is showing a healthy 5-year CAGR with the growth driven by brand Electral, which contributes to almost 50% of the market. The market is expected to grow during the next few months as the temperatures soar across the subcontinent. \"The market has a seasonality trend wherein the consumption increases from February onwards as the temperatures soar. While monsoons set in around June-July, the consumption stays on a higher side as a lot of water borne diseases spark ailments like dysentery and diarrhoea which also need oral electrolyte consumption during treatment,\" Sapale added. Doctors are already seeing an increasing number of cases with digestive problems . Dr Vipulroy Rathod, director-gastroenterology, Fortis Hospital (Mulund), Mumbai, said he was seeing more and more patients in the entire age spectrum, right from the very young people to the elderly with digestive disorders, than a decade ago.

Read Today's Paper Anxiety and stress-related concerns account for nearly half of all mental health consultations in India: Survey SECTIONS Anxiety and stress-related concerns account for nearly half of all mental health consultations in India: Survey By Brinda Sarkar , ET Bureau Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 04:57:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis A recent MediBuddy survey reveals a concerning rise in anxiety and stress among India's millennial workforce, accounting for nearly 50% of mental health consultations. The study highlights work-life imbalance, digital burnout, and economic uncertainty as key contributors. Targeted mental health interventions in workplaces are crucial to support young professionals and foster a healthier environment. iStock Anxiety-related issues remain highly prevalent in India, comprising 32.28% of all consultations, followed closely by stressor-related concerns at 17.15%, together accounting for nearly 50% of all mental health consultations in the country, according to a new survey. Data from digital healthcare company MediBuddy showed a sharp rise in emotional stress among the millennial workforce. The company's psychological consultation data from October-December 2024 reveals alarming mental health trends among the millennial workforce , with anxiety and stress emerging as dominant concerns affecting nearly half the cases. The study, which analysed data from 2,400 consultations taken by expert psychologists for clients across various age groups and genders, brings to light the urgent need for targeted mental health interventions in workplace environments, particularly for young professionals aged 20-40 who exhibit the highest prevalence of anxiety and stress-related conditions. The study reviewed specific reasons causing these mental health issues. Among Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012), young men frequently face burnout due to professional and societal pressures, while young women often struggle with financial instability and the demand for social validation, influenced by societal norms and digital exposure. Relationship-related stress and body image concerns were noted as significant mental health challenges for both genders in this age group. For millennials, several factors contribute to rising mental health concerns. Work-life imbalance is a key issue, as individuals struggle to balance career growth, financial security and personal milestones, leading to chronic stress. Digital burnout, fuelled by constant connectivity, erodes the boundaries between work and personal life, making it difficult to disconnect and recharge. Economic uncertainty further exacerbates anxiety, fostering feelings of career instability and financial pressure. Women, in particular, face the added challenge of balancing career advancement with family responsibilities, which often affects their physical and mental well-being. The study also highlighted the role of social media in exacerbating these issues, as social comparison fosters unrealistic performance expectations and amplifies emotional distress. Gender-based analysis reveals notable differences: males reported higher anxiety-related complaints (16.95% compared to 15.20% in females), while females exhibited higher stress levels (9.11% versus 7.97% in males). Depression affected both genders equally, with rates of 2.48% in males and 2.44% in females. This highlights the difference in presentation of mental health issues, response to triggers and coping mechanisms among the genders. \u201cThese results highlight a critical mental health crisis affecting our most productive workforce demographic. Emotional stress and anxiety are silent tormentors that can have far-reaching consequences on productivity, relationships, and overall well-being. The high-pressure nature of modern careers, coupled with lifestyle instability, is driving this rise,\u201d said Dr Gowri Kulkarni, head of medical operations, MediBuddy. Live Events \u201cA key challenge is that many young people lack exposure to effective coping strategies and emotional resilience training, leaving them ill-equipped to handle stress. Unrealistic expectations from themselves and others, fuelled by social comparisons and professional pressures, further intensify feelings of inadequacy and stress,\u201d she said. \u201cThrough early intervention, regular mental health screenings and expert-led therapy sessions, we aim to equip employees with the tools to manage stress and improve emotional well-being.\u201d The study underscored the need for comprehensive mental health support in professional environments. Organisations must prioritise mental wellness through targeted interventions, including stress management programs, digital detox initiatives and mental health counselling, to empower employees to navigate these pressures and foster a healthier, more balanced work environment, it said.

The Feed Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 07:39:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis A foldable iPhone from Apple remains one of the top expectations from tech enthusiasts around the world. As per a latest rumor, it has been suggested that the much-anticipated device will be made available anywhere between $2,100 and $2,300 by the Cupertino giant. The foldable phones market has gained significant momentum in recent times, with many tech companies launching back-to-back smartphones, with all the latest updates and specifications. Amid high expectations from fans, Apple is expected to introduce its maiden foldable iPhone soon in the global market. However, many would be surprised to know that their dream to have a foldable iPhone might not be that much affordable since it would cost more than some of the best Apple products, as per a recent leak by Instant Digital. Foldable iPhone price: What to expect? In a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, the rumor from the leakster suggests that the foldable iPhones may cost anywhere between $2,100 and $2,300 at the time of release. \"Based on the iPhone's profit margin, the iPhone foldable screen is estimated to start at between $2,100 and $2,300, not much more expensive than Samsung,\" read the post. This is significantly higher in comparison with other foldable smartphones that are already available in the market, including the popular Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. Live Events The sixth series handset from the tech giant is available at $1,899 for the lower variant, while the 1TB version costs $2,259, Tom's Guide reported. Among other popular options out there are Oppo Find N5 for roughly $1,800 and OnePlus Open at $1,699. The report suggests that the Cupertino giant will have to \"pull out some impressive hardware\" if at all the company is planning to sell its first ever foldable smartphones in that price range.

Screen As far as the screen of the expected foldable iPhone is concerned, several reports have suggested varied screen sizes for the handset. In March this year, it was stated that the foldable iPhone might come with a 7.8-inch primary display as well as the 5.5-inch cover display when folded. Keeping this in mind, it makes it quite similar to OnePlus Open, which remains available at a cheaper rate. Also, there have been rumors indicating that the foldable iPhone could boast a 7.74-inch inner display and a 5.49-inch outer display -- making it look close enough to the Oppo Find N5. Additionally, some have even claimed it to have a 12-inch screen when unfolded, which seems like an impractical idea. 2. Camera Cameras have remained one of the major highlights for Apple products. It is said that Apple might include a main lens, an ultrawide lens as well as a selfie camera to its rumoured foldable iPhone. Further details about the camera currently remain under the carpet.

Other details Rumours have suggested that the expected phone can come with a 5,000mAh battery, while the screen's integrated driver circuit has got a major upgrade from 28nm process to 16nm. FAQs 1. When will Apple release its foldable iPhone? No official details have been shared about the product, but reports claim that it can come out anytime in 2026. 2. What are the famous foldable smartphones available in the market? Some of the popular options include Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, OnePlus Open and Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

Read Today's Paper Anant Ambani\u2019s spiritual pilgrimage from Jamnagar to Dwarka nears completion SECTIONS Anant Ambani\u2019s spiritual pilgrimage from Jamnagar to Dwarka nears completion ET Special Last Updated: Apr 01, 2025, 06:31:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Anant Ambani from Reliance Industries is undertaking a five-day padayatra from Jamnagar to Dwarka, visiting temples and engaging in prayers. Accompanied by high security, he also made an act of kindness by rescuing a truckload of chickens. His pilgrimage will conclude at the Dwarkadhish temple. ET Special Reliance Industries Director Anant Ambani has undertaken a sacred padayatra, or pilgrimage, on foot from his residence in Jamnagar to the Dwarkadhish temple in the revered city of Lord Krishna, Dwarka. This five-day pilgrimage will conclude with his visit to the temple ahead of his upcoming 30th birthday on April 9th. Covering approximately 10-12 kilometres each day, his journey has included frequent temple visits along the route, where he has been actively engaging in prayers and chants. Devotees have welcomed him with traditional recitations and blessings at various stops. Anant Ambani\u2019s padyatra is a testament to his personal devotion and perseverance. Despite dealing with chronic health conditions such as asthma and fibrosis from a young age, he is set to cover the 140-km journey entirely on foot. The physically demanding trek would be challenging for anyone, yet for Anant, it is a spiritual commitment rather than a display of endurance. His journey reflects his deep faith in spirituality. For many young Indians navigating life\u2019s challenges, his pilgrimage serves as a reminder that resilience can be quiet, and faith remains a powerful force. View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Economic Times (@economictimes) Beyond his spiritual commitment, Ambani also made a compassionate gesture during the journey by rescuing a truckload of chickens en route. Reports indicate that he halted the vehicle, purchased the birds, and arranged for their proper care, demonstrating his concern for animal welfare. The pilgrimage is expected to conclude soon with his prayers at the Dwarkadhish temple. His padayatra has garnered significant attention, resonating with many followers who view it as a testament to his unwavering faith and devotion.

Read Today's Paper Advertorial Understanding the enduring value of natural diamonds in a changing market SECTIONS Understanding the enduring value of natural diamonds in a changing market By Smita Mishra , ET Spotlight Last Updated: Apr 16, 2025, 01:23:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Natural diamonds maintain their allure in India, driven by cultural significance and rising incomes, contrasting with the fluctuating value of lab-grown alternatives. India's diamond industry thrives, processing a significant portion of the world's diamonds while prioritizing ethical sourcing and sustainability. Light performance and cut are crucial factors influencing a diamond's appearance and value. ET Spotlight Natural diamonds have long been synonymous with luxury, commitment, and legacy. In India, where weddings remain a grand affair, diamonds hold deep cultural and emotional significance. As income levels rise and the desire for luxury intensifies, the preference for natural diamonds continues to thrive, reflecting not only social status but also an investment in lasting value. Timeless and lasting appeal across generations From baby boomers to generation Z, natural diamonds hold universal appeal. Unlike alternatives that may diminish in value over time, natural diamonds retain their significance across generations. Consumers no longer seek flashy possessions; they want items that stand the test of time. Natural diamonds carry intrinsic value, rarity, and prestige\u2014 qualities that mass-produced alternatives simply cannot replicate. Even from the perspective of value and resale, natural diamonds remain a preferred choice. From 2015 to 2024, the price of a 1.5-carat diamond that is not naturally grown decreased by over 83% in some cases. According to several global reports, the future of man-made diamonds remain uncertain as producers face challenges related to profitability and market saturation. In this scenario, natural diamonds hold a competitive edge. The enduring value of natural diamonds lies in their rarity, heritage, and sustained worth. As global demand for responsibly sourced diamonds continues to grow, India's diamond industry remains at the forefront of this evolution. Live Events Natural diamonds vs. manufactured alternatives In July 2024, the United States, the world\u2019s largest market for diamond jewellery , experienced a 6.5% growth in diamond jewellery sales. According to Paul Rowley, Vice President of Diamond Trading at De Beers, \"India, on the other hand, is an emerging market expected to see double-digit growth.\u201d Unlike mass-produced commodities that become cheaper over time, like in the semiconductor industry, natural diamonds remain rare and exclusive. In contrast, engineered gems face price drops due to large-scale production and diverse uses beyond jewellery, such as in fashion and accessories. In the U.S., the price of engineered gems has declined significantly due to increased supply and expanding applications. ET Spotlight Natural diamonds: A steady demand India's diamond industry is witnessing growth across major markets. With increasing consumer preference for responsibly-sourced natural diamonds, demand remains robust. With India now representing 11% of global demand for natural diamond jewellery , the country has surpassed China to become the second-largest market in the world. Diamonds: A major player in the economy India plays a pivotal role in the global diamond industry , processing over 90% of the world's diamonds. According to Bain & Co, despite fluctuations, natural diamond prices have seen an average year-on-year growth of 3% over the last 35 years. Furthermore, 99.8% of natural diamonds are certified conflict-free by the UN and WTO-mandated Kimberley Process (KP). Several major players are implementing responsible practices, such as the Tata Sustainability and Ethics Programme (TSEP), ensuring ethical sourcing, sustainable practices, and improved working conditions in processing units. ET Spotlight A diamond\u2019s true magic reveals itself in the way it plays with light While the commonly considered parameters for evaluating a diamond\u2019s quality are the four Cs\u2014cut, clarity, colour, and carat\u2014light performance remains the most essential factor. Diamond light performance is evaluated using several metrics that measure how effectively a stone reflects and manipulates light. True light performance is typically assessed through key factors such as brilliance, fire, scintillation, contrast, and symmetry of light return. ET Spotlight Does a larger carat mean a bigger diamond? Not necessarily. Although a higher carat usually indicates a larger diamond, its apparent size depends on several factors: Cut \u2013 A well-cut natural diamond reflects more light, making it appear larger. Shape \u2013 Some shapes, such as oval or marquise, appear larger than round diamonds of the same caratage. Depth and spread \u2013 A natural diamond with greater depth may have more weight beneath the surface.
